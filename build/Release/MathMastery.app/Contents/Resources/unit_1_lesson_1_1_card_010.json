    "explanation": "Let's create a function from a real scenario: A streaming service charges $12/month plus $3 for each premium movie rented.\n\nStep 1: Identify the input and output\nâ€¢ Input: Number of premium movies (m)\nâ€¢ Output: Total monthly cost (C)\n\nStep 2: Find the pattern\nâ€¢ Base cost: $12\nâ€¢ Variable cost: $3 per movie\nâ€¢ Total: Base + (Rate Ã— Movies)",
    "example": "ðŸŽ¬ Building the function:\n\nC(m) = 12 + 3m\n\nTesting our function:\nâ€¢ 0 movies: C(0) = 12 + 3(0) = $12\nâ€¢ 2 movies: C(2) = 12 + 3(2) = $18\nâ€¢ 5 movies: C(5) = 12 + 3(5) = $27\n\nDomain: 0 or more movies (can't rent negative movies)\nRange: $12 or more (minimum is base subscription)",
    "key_point": "Real-world functions often follow the pattern: Fixed amount + (Rate Ã— Variable)."
