    "explanation": "Function notation is mathematical shorthand that makes everything clearer!\n\nInstead of writing: 'y equals 2 times x plus 3'\nWe write: f(x) = 2x + 3\n\nüî§ f(x) is read as 'f of x'\n‚ùå NOT 'f times x'\n‚úÖ It means 'the output when the input is x'\n\nYou can use any letter: f(x), g(x), h(x), C(t), etc. The letter often relates to what the function represents (C for cost, h for height, etc.).",
    "example": "üì± If C(h) = 10 + 5h represents phone bill cost:\n‚Ä¢ C(0) = $10 (0 hours of calls)\n‚Ä¢ C(3) = $25 (3 hours of calls)\n‚Ä¢ C(h) = 40 means you used 6 hours",
    "key_point": "f(x) is a compact way to say 'function f applied to input x'."
