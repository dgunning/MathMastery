    "problem": "A function is represented by the following table of values:\nx | -2 | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3\ny | 4  | 1  | 0 | 1 | 4 | 9\nDetermine: a) if this represents a function, b) the domain, and c) the range.",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: Determine if this is a function\nCheck if any x-value appears more than once with different y-values\nEach x-value appears exactly once, so this is a function",
      "Step 2: Find the domain\nThe domain consists of all x-values in the table\nDomain = {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3}",
      "Step 3: Find the range\nThe range consists of all y-values in the table\nRange = {0, 1, 4, 9}"
    ],
    "explanation": "When working with a function given as a table of values, the domain is the set of all input values shown, and the range is the set of all output values. Note that some y-values may appear multiple times (like 1 and 4 in this example)."
