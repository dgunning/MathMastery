    "explanation": "The graphical method for solving linear-quadratic systems involves plotting both the linear equation and the quadratic equation on the same coordinate plane and identifying the points of intersection.\n\nSteps for the graphical method:\n\n1. Graph the linear equation y = mx + b\n   - Plot at least two points and draw a straight line through them\n   - Alternatively, use the slope-intercept form to identify the y-intercept (0, b) and use the slope m to find additional points\n\n2. Graph the quadratic equation y = ax² + bx + c\n   - Identify the vertex (-b/(2a), f(-b/(2a)))\n   - Find the y-intercept (0, c)\n   - Plot additional points as needed\n   - Draw a smooth parabola through the points\n\n3. Identify the intersection points\n   - These are the points where the line and parabola cross\n   - Read the x and y coordinates of these points\n\n4. Verify the solutions\n   - Substitute the x and y values into both original equations to confirm they satisfy both equations\n\nAdvantages of the graphical method:\n- Provides a visual understanding of the system\n- Shows the number of solutions at a glance\n- Helps verify solutions found by algebraic methods\n\nLimitations of the graphical method:\n- May lack precision, especially with irrational solutions\n- Requires accurate graphing\n- Can be time-consuming for complex equations",
    "example": "Let's solve the following linear-quadratic system graphically:\n\ny = x + 2         (linear equation)\ny = x² - 1        (quadratic equation)\n\nStep 1: Graph the linear equation y = x + 2\n- The y-intercept is (0, 2)\n- Using the slope of 1, we can find additional points: (1, 3), (2, 4), (-1, 1), etc.\n- Draw a straight line through these points\n\nStep 2: Graph the quadratic equation y = x² - 1\n- The vertex is at (0, -1)\n- The y-intercept is (0, -1)\n- Additional points: (1, 0), (2, 3), (-1, 0), (-2, 3), etc.\n- Draw a smooth parabola through these points\n\nStep 3: Identify the intersection points\n- The line and parabola intersect at approximately (-2, 0) and (1, 3)\n\nStep 4: Verify these solutions\nFor the point (-2, 0):\n- Linear equation: 0 = -2 + 2 = 0 ✓\n- Quadratic equation: 0 = (-2)² - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 ✗\nThis point is not accurate from our graph.\n\nFor the point (1, 3):\n- Linear equation: 3 = 1 + 2 = 3 ✓\n- Quadratic equation: 3 = 1² - 1 = 0 ✗\nThis point is also not accurate.\n\nThis demonstrates a limitation of the graphical method. Let's solve algebraically to verify:\n\nx + 2 = x² - 1\n0 = x² - x - 3\n0 = (x - 3)(x + 1)\nx = 3 or x = -1\n\nFor x = 3: y = 3 + 2 = 5\nFor x = -1: y = -1 + 2 = 1\n\nSo the actual solutions are (3, 5) and (-1, 1).",
    "key_point": "When using the graphical method for linear-quadratic systems:\n\n1. Ensure your graphs are accurate by plotting sufficient points\n\n2. Use graph paper or graphing technology for better precision\n\n3. The number of intersection points tells you the number of solutions:\n   - No intersections: no solutions\n   - One intersection: one solution (the line is tangent to the parabola)\n   - Two intersections: two solutions\n\n4. Always verify graphical solutions algebraically when precision is important\n\n5. The graphical method is most valuable for understanding the nature of the system and estimating solutions, rather than for finding exact values"
