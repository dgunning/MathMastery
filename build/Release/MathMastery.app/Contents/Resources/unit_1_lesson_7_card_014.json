    "problem": "Convert the quadratic function f(x) = 2x² - 3x + 1 to vertex form by completing the square.",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: Factor out the leading coefficient from the first two terms\nf(x) = 2(x² - 3x/2) + 1",
      "Step 2: Complete the square inside the parentheses\nFor x² - 3x/2, take half of -3/2, which is -3/4, and square it: (-3/4)² = 9/16\nf(x) = 2(x² - 3x/2 + 9/16 - 9/16) + 1\nf(x) = 2((x - 3/4)² - 9/16) + 1",
      "Step 3: Distribute the leading coefficient\nf(x) = 2(x - 3/4)² - 2(9/16) + 1\nf(x) = 2(x - 3/4)² - 18/16 + 1",
      "Step 4: Simplify the constant terms\nf(x) = 2(x - 3/4)² - 18/16 + 16/16\nf(x) = 2(x - 3/4)² - 2/16\nf(x) = 2(x - 3/4)² - 1/8",
      "Step 5: Verify by expanding\n2(x - 3/4)² - 1/8 = 2(x² - 3x/2 + 9/16) - 1/8\n= 2x² - 3x + 18/16 - 2/16\n= 2x² - 3x + 16/16\n= 2x² - 3x + 1 ✓"
    ],
    "explanation": "Completing the square with fractions requires careful attention to detail, especially when finding half of the coefficient of x and when squaring that value. The process is the same as with integers, but the arithmetic can be more challenging."
