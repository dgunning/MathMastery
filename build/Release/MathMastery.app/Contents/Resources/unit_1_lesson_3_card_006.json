    "problem": "Find the domain and range of the function f(x) = √(16 - x²)",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: To find the domain, identify values of x that make the function undefined.\nSince we can't take the square root of a negative number, we need 16 - x² ≥ 0",
      "Step 2: Solve the inequality 16 - x² ≥ 0\nx² ≤ 16\n-4 ≤ x ≤ 4\nSo the domain is [-4, 4]",
      "Step 3: To find the range, analyze what values f(x) can take.\nWhen x = 0, f(0) = √16 = 4 (maximum value)\nWhen x = ±4, f(±4) = √(16 - 16) = √0 = 0 (minimum value)\nSince f(x) is the square root of a non-negative number, the range is [0, 4]"
    ],
    "explanation": "For functions involving square roots, the expression under the radical must be non-negative to be in the domain. For this function, as x moves away from 0 in either direction, the value of f(x) decreases from 4 to 0."
