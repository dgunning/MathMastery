    "problem": "Solve the following problems involving specific discriminant values:\n\n1. Find the value of k such that the equation x² + kx + 4 = 0 has exactly one real solution.\n\n2. For what values of p will the equation 2x² + px + 3 = 0 have two distinct real solutions?\n\n3. Find the value of m such that the discriminant of the equation x² + mx + 9 = 0 equals 25.",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: For a quadratic equation to have exactly one real solution, its discriminant must be zero: Δ = b² - 4ac = 0.",
      "Step 2: For the equation x² + kx + 4 = 0, identify the coefficients: a = 1, b = k, c = 4.",
      "Step 3: Set up the discriminant equation and solve for k:\nk² - 4(1)(4) = 0\nk² - 16 = 0\nk² = 16\nk = ±4\nSo k = 4 or k = -4 will make the equation have exactly one real solution.",
      "Step 4: For a quadratic equation to have two distinct real solutions, its discriminant must be positive: Δ = b² - 4ac > 0.",
      "Step 5: For the equation 2x² + px + 3 = 0, identify the coefficients: a = 2, b = p, c = 3.",
      "Step 6: Set up the discriminant inequality and solve for p:\np² - 4(2)(3) > 0\np² - 24 > 0\np² > 24\np < -√24 or p > √24\np < -2√6 or p > 2√6\nSo the equation will have two distinct real solutions when p < -2√6 or p > 2√6.",
      "Step 7: For the equation x² + mx + 9 = 0 to have a discriminant of 25, we need: Δ = b² - 4ac = 25.",
      "Step 8: Identify the coefficients: a = 1, b = m, c = 9.",
      "Step 9: Set up the equation and solve for m:\nm² - 4(1)(9) = 25\nm² - 36 = 25\nm² = 61\nm = ±√61\nSo m = √61 or m = -√61 will make the discriminant equal to 25."
    ],
    "explanation": "When solving problems involving specific discriminant values, we use the discriminant formula Δ = b² - 4ac and set up equations or inequalities based on the desired conditions:\n\n1. For exactly one real solution (repeated root): Δ = 0\n   - This leads to an equation: b² - 4ac = 0\n   - Solve for the unknown parameter\n\n2. For two distinct real solutions: Δ > 0\n   - This leads to an inequality: b² - 4ac > 0\n   - Solve for the unknown parameter\n\n3. For no real solutions (complex roots): Δ < 0\n   - This leads to an inequality: b² - 4ac < 0\n   - Solve for the unknown parameter\n\n4. For a specific discriminant value: Δ = k\n   - This leads to an equation: b² - 4ac = k\n   - Solve for the unknown parameter\n\nThese problems often involve solving quadratic equations or inequalities in the unknown parameter."
