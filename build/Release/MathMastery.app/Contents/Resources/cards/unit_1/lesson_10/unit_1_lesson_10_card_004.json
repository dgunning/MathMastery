    "problem": "For each of the following quadratic equations:\n1. Determine the discriminant\n2. Describe the nature of the roots\n3. Find the roots\n\nEquations:\na) x² + 6x + 9 = 0\nb) 2x² - 5x - 3 = 0\nc) x² + x + 1 = 0",

      "Step 1: For equation a) x² + 6x + 9 = 0, identify the coefficients: a = 1, b = 6, c = 9.",

      "Step 3: Since Δ = 0, equation a) has one repeated real root (a double root). The root is x = -b/(2a) = -6/(2(1)) = -3. We can verify this is correct by factoring: x² + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)².",

      "Step 6: Since Δ = 49 > 0, equation b) has two distinct real roots. Using the quadratic formula:\nx = (-b ± √Δ)/(2a)\nx = (5 ± √49)/(2(2))\nx = (5 ± 7)/4\nx = 3 or x = -1/2\nWe can verify by factoring: 2x² - 5x - 3 = (2x - 3)(x + 1) = 0.",

      "Step 9: Since Δ = -3 < 0, equation c) has two complex conjugate roots. Using the quadratic formula:\nx = (-b ± i√|Δ|)/(2a)\nx = (-1 ± i√3)/(2(1))\nx = -1/2 ± (√3/2)i\nThese are complex numbers with real part -1/2 and imaginary part ±√3/2."

    "explanation": "The discriminant not only tells us the nature of the roots but also helps us determine the most efficient method for finding them:\n\n1. When Δ = 0 (zero discriminant):\n   - The equation has one repeated root: x = -b/(2a)\n   - The quadratic expression is a perfect square trinomial: a(x + b/(2a))²\n   - Example: x² + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)²\n\n2. When Δ > 0 (positive discriminant):\n   - The equation has two distinct real roots\n   - If Δ is a perfect square, the roots are rational and the expression can be factored with rational coefficients\n   - If Δ is not a perfect square, the roots are irrational\n   - Example: 2x² - 5x - 3 = (2x - 3)(x + 1)\n\n3. When Δ < 0 (negative discriminant):\n   - The equation has two complex conjugate roots\n   - The expression cannot be factored with real coefficients\n   - Example: x² + x + 1 cannot be factored with real numbers"
