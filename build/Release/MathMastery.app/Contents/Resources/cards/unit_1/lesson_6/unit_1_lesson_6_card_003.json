    "problem": "Find the maximum or minimum value of the quadratic function f(x) = 2(x - 3)² + 5.",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: Identify whether the function has a maximum or minimum value\nThe function is in vertex form f(x) = a(x - h)² + k\nSince a = 2 > 0, the parabola opens upward and has a minimum value",
      "Step 2: Identify the vertex from the vertex form\nComparing with f(x) = a(x - h)² + k, we have h = 3 and k = 5\nSo the vertex is at (3, 5)",
      "Step 3: State the answer\nThe minimum value of the function is 5, which occurs at x = 3"
    ],
    "explanation": "When a quadratic function is given in vertex form f(x) = a(x - h)² + k, the maximum or minimum value is simply k, and it occurs at x = h. This is one of the advantages of the vertex form - it makes the maximum or minimum value immediately apparent."
