  "content": {
    "problem": "Find the quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0 that satisfies the given constraints:\n\n1. The equation has integer coefficients with a = 1, and roots 2 + √3 and 2 - √3\n2. The equation has rational coefficients, one root is 4, and the graph passes through the point (2, -8)\n3. The equation has integer coefficients, the sum of its roots is 5, and the product of its roots is 6",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: For problem 1, we have roots 2 + √3 and 2 - √3, with a = 1.",
      "Step 2: Using the factored form: (x - (2 + √3))(x - (2 - √3)) = 0.",
      "Step 3: Expand: (x - 2 - √3)(x - 2 + √3) = (x - 2)² - (√3)² = (x - 2)² - 3 = x² - 4x + 4 - 3 = x² - 4x + 1.",
      "Step 4: Therefore, the quadratic equation is x² - 4x + 1 = 0.",
      "Step 5: For problem 2, one root is 4, so the equation can be written as (x - 4)(x - r) = 0, where r is the other root.",
      "Step 6: Expand: x² - rx - 4x + 4r = x² - (r + 4)x + 4r.",
      "Step 7: We know the graph passes through (2, -8), so f(2) = -8.",
      "Step 8: Using the factored form: f(2) = (2 - 4)(2 - r) = -2(2 - r) = -8.",
      "Step 9: Solving for r: -2(2 - r) = -8, so 2 - r = 4, which gives r = -2.",
      "Step 10: Therefore, the quadratic equation is (x - 4)(x - (-2)) = 0, which expands to x² - 2x - 8 = 0.",
      "Step 11: For problem 3, we know the sum of roots is 5 and the product is 6, with integer coefficients.",
      "Step 12: Using Vieta's formulas with a = 1: r + s = 5 = -b/1, so b = -5.",
      "Step 13: Also, r × s = 6 = c/1, so c = 6.",
      "Step 14: Therefore, the quadratic equation is x² - 5x + 6 = 0.",
      "Step 15: We can verify by factoring: x² - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0, which has roots 2 and 3.",
      "Step 16: Indeed, 2 + 3 = 5 and 2 × 3 = 6, confirming our solution."

    "explanation": "When finding a quadratic equation with specific constraints, we need to carefully analyze the given information and choose the most appropriate approach:\n\n1. For equations with irrational or complex roots:\n   - If the roots are conjugates (like 2 + √3 and 2 - √3), the resulting equation will have rational or integer coefficients\n   - Use the pattern (x - (a + b))(x - (a - b)) = (x - a)² - b²\n   - This approach simplifies the algebra and ensures we get the correct coefficients\n\n2. For equations with one known root and a point on the graph:\n   - Use the factored form (x - r₁)(x - r₂) = 0, where r₁ is the known root\n   - Substitute the coordinates of the given point to find r₂\n   - Expand to get the standard form\n\n3. For equations with given sum and product of roots:\n   - Apply Vieta's formulas directly: r + s = -b/a and r × s = c/a\n   - Choose a value for a (often a = 1 for simplicity) and calculate b and c\n   - Verify the solution by factoring or checking that the discriminant gives the expected types of roots\n\nThese approaches allow us to find quadratic equations that satisfy various constraints, even when we don't know the exact roots or when the roots are irrational or complex numbers."
