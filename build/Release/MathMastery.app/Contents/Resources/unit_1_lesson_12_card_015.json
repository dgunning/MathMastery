    "explanation": "In this lesson, we've explored linear-quadratic systems, which consist of one linear equation and one quadratic equation in two variables. Let's review the key concepts and methods covered:\n\n1. Types of Equations in Linear-Quadratic Systems\n   - Linear equation: ax + by + c = 0 or y = mx + b\n   - Quadratic equation: y = ax² + bx + c or other forms involving quadratic terms\n\n2. Solution Methods\n   - Graphical method: Plot both equations and identify intersection points\n   - Substitution method: Express one variable in terms of the other using the linear equation, then substitute into the quadratic equation\n   - Elimination method: Set the two expressions for the same variable equal to each other\n\n3. Number of Solutions\n   - Two real solutions: The line intersects the parabola at two distinct points (discriminant > 0)\n   - One real solution: The line is tangent to the parabola (discriminant = 0)\n   - No real solutions: The line doesn't intersect the parabola (discriminant < 0)\n\n4. Using the Discriminant\n   - After reducing to a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0, calculate Δ = b² - 4ac\n   - The value of Δ determines the number of solutions\n   - For systems with parameters, the discriminant helps find conditions for specific solution types\n\n5. Special Cases\n   - Horizontal lines: y = k may intersect a parabola 0, 1, or 2 times\n   - Vertical lines: x = h always intersect a parabola exactly once (assuming the parabola opens vertically)\n   - Lines through the vertex: May be tangent or intersect twice\n   - Degenerate cases: When the quadratic term cancels out\n\n6. Real-World Applications\n   - Motion problems: Projectile motion, object collisions\n   - Economics: Break-even analysis, profit maximization\n   - Geometry: Area and perimeter relationships\n   - Optimization problems: Maximizing or minimizing quantities subject to constraints\n\nRemember that the choice of method depends on the specific problem and what information you need:\n- Use the graphical method for visual understanding and approximations\n- Use substitution or elimination for exact solutions\n- Use the discriminant for analyzing the number of solutions or finding parameter values\n\nAlways verify your solutions by checking that they satisfy both original equations, and interpret them in the context of the problem when dealing with real-world applications.",
    "example": "Comprehensive Example: Analyzing a Linear-Quadratic System\n\nConsider the system:\ny = mx + 2\ny = x² - 4x + 5\n\nwhere m is a parameter.\n\n1. Using the Elimination Method:\nSetting the equations equal:\nmx + 2 = x² - 4x + 5\n0 = x² - (m+4)x + 3\n\n2. Analyzing the Discriminant:\nΔ = (m+4)² - 4(1)(3) = (m+4)² - 12\n\n3. Number of Solutions Based on m:\n- For two distinct solutions: Δ > 0\n  (m+4)² - 12 > 0\n  (m+4)² > 12\n  |m+4| > √12 ≈ 3.46\n  m < -7.46 or m > -0.54\n\n- For exactly one solution (tangent): Δ = 0\n  (m+4)² - 12 = 0\n  (m+4)² = 12\n  m+4 = ±√12 = ±2√3\n  m = -4±2√3 ≈ -4±3.46\n  m ≈ -7.46 or m ≈ -0.54\n\n- For no solutions: Δ < 0\n  (m+4)² - 12 < 0\n  (m+4)² < 12\n  -√12 < m+4 < √12\n  -7.46 < m < -0.54\n\n4. Finding Solutions for a Specific Value:\nLet's choose m = 2 (which gives two solutions):\n0 = x² - 6x + 3\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\nx = (6 ± √(36-12))/2 = (6 ± √24)/2 = (6 ± 2√6)/2 = 3 ± √6\n\nThe x-coordinates are approximately 3 + 2.45 ≈ 5.45 and 3 - 2.45 ≈ 0.55.\n\nThe corresponding y-coordinates are:\nFor x ≈ 5.45: y = 2(5.45) + 2 ≈ 12.9\nFor x ≈ 0.55: y = 2(0.55) + 2 ≈ 3.1\n\n5. Verification:\nFor (5.45, 12.9):\n- Linear: y = 2(5.45) + 2 ≈ 12.9 ✓\n- Quadratic: y = (5.45)² - 4(5.45) + 5 ≈ 29.7 - 21.8 + 5 ≈ 12.9 ✓\n\nFor (0.55, 3.1):\n- Linear: y = 2(0.55) + 2 ≈ 3.1 ✓\n- Quadratic: y = (0.55)² - 4(0.55) + 5 ≈ 0.3 - 2.2 + 5 ≈ 3.1 ✓\n\nThis example demonstrates how to:\n- Use the elimination method to solve the system\n- Analyze how the number of solutions depends on a parameter\n- Find specific solutions for a given parameter value\n- Verify the solutions by checking both equations",
