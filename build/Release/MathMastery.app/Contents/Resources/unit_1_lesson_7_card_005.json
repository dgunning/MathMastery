  "content": {
    "explanation": "The standard form of a quadratic function is f(x) = ax² + bx + c, while the vertex form is f(x) = a(x - h)² + k, where (h, k) is the vertex.\n\nCompleting the square allows us to convert from standard form to vertex form, which makes it easier to:\n\n1. Identify the vertex (h, k) of the parabola\n2. Determine the maximum or minimum value of the function\n3. Graph the parabola more easily\n4. Analyze the function's behavior",
    "example": "To convert f(x) = x² - 6x + 8 to vertex form:\n\n1. Group the x-terms: f(x) = (x² - 6x) + 8\n2. Complete the square: half of -6 is -3, and (-3)² = 9\n   f(x) = (x² - 6x + 9 - 9) + 8\n   f(x) = (x - 3)² - 9 + 8\n   f(x) = (x - 3)² - 1\n\nSo the vertex form is f(x) = (x - 3)² - 1, and the vertex is (3, -1)",
    "key_point": "The vertex form f(x) = a(x - h)² + k directly shows that the vertex is at (h, k). This is why completing the square is such a valuable technique for analyzing quadratic functions."
