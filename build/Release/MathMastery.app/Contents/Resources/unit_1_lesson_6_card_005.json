    "explanation": "Maximum and minimum values of quadratic functions have many important real-world applications:\n\n1. Maximizing profit or revenue in business\n2. Minimizing costs in manufacturing or operations\n3. Finding the maximum height of a projectile\n4. Determining optimal dimensions for area or volume problems\n5. Analyzing the peak or trough of data that follows a quadratic pattern\n\nIn these applications, the vertex of the parabola represents the optimal solution to the problem.",
    "example": "A company's profit function is P(x) = -2x² + 120x - 1000, where x is the number of items produced.\n\nSince a = -2 < 0, this function has a maximum value.\nThe maximum occurs at x = -b/(2a) = -(120)/(2(-2)) = 120/4 = 30.\nThe maximum profit is P(30) = -2(30)² + 120(30) - 1000 = -1800 + 3600 - 1000 = $800.\n\nSo the company should produce 30 items to maximize profit at $800.",
    "key_point": "In optimization problems, we're often looking for the maximum or minimum value of a quadratic function. The x-coordinate of the vertex tells us the input that optimizes the outcome, and the y-coordinate tells us the optimal value."
