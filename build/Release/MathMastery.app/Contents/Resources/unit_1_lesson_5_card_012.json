    "problem": "Find the equation of a quadratic function in the form f(x) = a(x - h)² + k that has its vertex at (2, -3) and passes through the point (4, 5).",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: Start with the vertex form of the quadratic function\nf(x) = a(x - h)² + k\nSince the vertex is at (2, -3), we have h = 2 and k = -3\nf(x) = a(x - 2)² - 3",
      "Step 2: Use the given point (4, 5) to find the value of a\nSince the point (4, 5) lies on the function, we have f(4) = 5\n5 = a(4 - 2)² - 3\n5 = a(4) - 3\n8 = 4a\na = 2",
      "Step 3: Write the final equation by substituting the value of a\nf(x) = 2(x - 2)² - 3",
      "Step 4: Expand the equation if needed (optional)\nf(x) = 2(x² - 4x + 4) - 3\nf(x) = 2x² - 8x + 8 - 3\nf(x) = 2x² - 8x + 5"
    ],
    "explanation": "When given the vertex and another point on a parabola, we can use the vertex form and substitute the known point to find the value of a. This approach is often simpler than trying to find three points and solving a system of equations."
