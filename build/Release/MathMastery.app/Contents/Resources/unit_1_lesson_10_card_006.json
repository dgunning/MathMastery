    "problem": "For each of the following quadratic functions:\n1. Calculate the discriminant\n2. Determine the position of the parabola relative to the x-axis\n3. Find the vertex of the parabola\n\nFunctions:\na) f(x) = 2x² - 4x - 6\nb) f(x) = 3x² + 6x + 3\nc) f(x) = -x² + 6x - 9",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: For function a) f(x) = 2x² - 4x - 6, identify the coefficients: a = 2, b = -4, c = -6.",
      "Step 2: Calculate the discriminant for function a):\nΔ = b² - 4ac\nΔ = (-4)² - 4(2)(-6)\nΔ = 16 + 48\nΔ = 64",
      "Step 3: Since Δ = 64 > 0, the parabola crosses the x-axis at two distinct points. The roots are:\nx = (-b ± √Δ)/(2a)\nx = (4 ± √64)/(2(2))\nx = (4 ± 8)/4\nx = 3 or x = -1\nSo the parabola crosses the x-axis at x = -1 and x = 3.",

      "Step 7: Since Δ = 0, the parabola touches the x-axis at exactly one point. The root is:\nx = -b/(2a) = -6/(2(3)) = -6/6 = -1\nSo the parabola touches the x-axis at x = -1.",
      "Step 8: The vertex of the parabola occurs at x = -b/(2a) = -6/(2(3)) = -1.\nThe y-coordinate of the vertex is f(-1) = 3(-1)² + 6(-1) + 3 = 3 - 6 + 3 = 0.\nSo the vertex is at (-1, 0), which is also the point where the parabola touches the x-axis.",

    ],
    "explanation": "The discriminant provides key information about the position of a parabola relative to the x-axis:\n\n1. When Δ > 0:\n   - The parabola crosses the x-axis at two distinct points\n   - If a > 0, the parabola opens upward and has a minimum value\n   - If a < 0, the parabola opens downward and has a maximum value\n\n2. When Δ = 0:\n   - The parabola touches the x-axis at exactly one point\n   - This point is also the vertex of the parabola\n   - The quadratic function can be written in the form f(x) = a(x - h)²\n\n3. When Δ < 0:\n   - The parabola doesn't intersect the x-axis\n   - If a > 0, the parabola lies entirely above the x-axis\n   - If a < 0, the parabola lies entirely below the x-axis\n\nThe vertex of the parabola always occurs at x = -b/(2a), regardless of the discriminant. The y-coordinate of the vertex is related to the discriminant by the formula f(-b/(2a)) = -Δ/(4a)."
