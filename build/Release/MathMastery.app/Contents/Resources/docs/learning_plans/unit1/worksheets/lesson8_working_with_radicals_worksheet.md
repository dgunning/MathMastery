## Part E: Applications with Radicals

13. The period $T$ (in seconds) of a simple pendulum is given by $T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$, where $L$ is the length of the pendulum (in meters) and $g = 9.8$ m/s² is the acceleration due to gravity.
    a) Find the period of a pendulum with length 2 meters.
    b) If the period of a pendulum is 3 seconds, what is its length?
    c) If the length of a pendulum is quadrupled, how does the period change?
    d) A pendulum on the moon has the same length as a pendulum on Earth, but the acceleration due to gravity on the moon is 1.6 m/s². How does the period of the pendulum on the moon compare to its period on Earth?

14. The distance $d$ (in miles) that you can see to the horizon from a height $h$ (in feet) is approximately $d = \sqrt{1.5h}$.
    a) How far can you see from a height of 100 feet?
    b) From what height can you see 20 miles to the horizon?
    c) If you double your height, by what factor does your viewing distance increase?
    d) You are in a hot air balloon. When you are at a height of 400 feet, you can see a ship on the horizon. If you rise to a height of 900 feet, how much farther can you see?

15. The time $t$ (in seconds) it takes an object to fall from a height $h$ (in meters) is given by $t = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}}$, where $g = 9.8$ m/s² is the acceleration due to gravity.
    a) How long does it take an object to fall from a height of 80 meters?
    b) From what height did an object fall if it took 3 seconds to hit the ground?
    c) If the time it takes to fall is doubled, by what factor does the height increase?
    d) An object is dropped from the top of a building and takes 4.5 seconds to hit the ground. How tall is the building?
