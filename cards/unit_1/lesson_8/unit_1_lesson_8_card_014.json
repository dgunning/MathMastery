    "problem": "Simplify the following complex radical expressions:\n1. √(8 + 2√15)\n2. (3 + √5)(2 - √5)",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: For √(8 + 2√15), we'll use the technique of denesting nested radicals.\nLet's assume √(8 + 2√15) = a + b√15, where a and b are rational numbers to be determined.",
      "Step 2: Square both sides to eliminate the outer radical.\n8 + 2√15 = (a + b√15)²\n8 + 2√15 = a² + 2ab√15 + b²(15)\n8 + 2√15 = a² + 15b² + 2ab√15",
      "Step 3: Compare coefficients on both sides.\nFor constant terms: 8 = a² + 15b²\nFor √15 terms: 2 = 2ab",
      "Step 4: From the second equation, we get a = 1/b.\nSubstituting into the first equation:\n8 = (1/b)² + 15b²\n8 = 1/b² + 15b²\n8b² = 1 + 15b⁴\n15b⁴ - 8b² + 1 = 0",
      "Step 5: This is a quadratic in b². Let u = b², then:\n15u² - 8u + 1 = 0\nUsing the quadratic formula:\nu = (8 ± √(64 - 60))/30\nu = (8 ± √4)/30\nu = (8 ± 2)/30",
      "Step 6: So u = 1/3 or u = 1/5. Since b must be rational, we take u = 1/3, so b = ±1/√3 = ±√3/3.\nSince a = 1/b, we get a = ±√3.",
      "Step 7: Testing a = √3 and b = √3/3:\na² + 15b² = 3 + 15(1/3) = 3 + 5 = 8 ✓\n2ab = 2(√3)(√3/3) = 2(3/3) = 2 ✓\nSo √(8 + 2√15) = √3 + (√3/3)√15 = √3 + √45/3 = √3 + √9·5/3 = √3 + 3√5/3",
      "Step 8: For (3 + √5)(2 - √5), use the distributive property.\n(3 + √5)(2 - √5) = 3(2) - 3(√5) + √5(2) - √5(√5)\n= 6 - 3√5 + 2√5 - 5\n= 6 - 5 - 3√5 + 2√5\n= 1 - √5"
    ],
    "explanation": "Complex radical expressions often involve nested radicals (radicals within radicals) or products of binomials involving radicals.\n\nFor nested radicals like √(a + b√c), we can sometimes denest them by finding rational values x and y such that √(a + b√c) = x + y√c. This involves setting up a system of equations by squaring both sides.\n\nFor products of binomials involving radicals, we use the distributive property and combine like terms, similar to multiplying binomials without radicals. Special products like (a + √b)(a - √b) = a² - b follow the difference of squares pattern."
