  "title": "Why Advanced Factoring Matters",
  "duration": 160,
  "content": {
    "explanation": "Advanced factoring techniques are essential for:\n\n• Solving complex quadratic equations\n• Simplifying rational expressions\n• Finding x-intercepts of polynomial graphs\n• Calculus applications (finding critical points)\n• Engineering and physics problem-solving",
    "example": "In physics, when modeling projectile motion, you might need to factor 4.9t² + 20t - 15 = 0 to find when an object hits the ground.",
    "key_point": "These skills build the foundation for advanced mathematics and real-world problem-solving."
