    "problem": "Factor: 3x² - 10x + 8",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: Calculate ac = 3 × 8 = 24",
      "Step 2: Find factors of 24 that add to -10\nFactors of 24: ±1×±24, ±2×±12, ±3×±8, ±4×±6\nWe need: (-4) + (-6) = -10 ✓ and (-4) × (-6) = 24 ✓",
      "Step 3: Split the middle term using -4 and -6\n3x² - 10x + 8 = 3x² - 4x - 6x + 8",
      "Step 4: Group the terms\n= (3x² - 4x) + (-6x + 8)",
      "Step 5: Factor each group\n= x(3x - 4) - 2(3x - 4)",
      "Step 6: Factor out the common binomial\n= (3x - 4)(x - 2)"
    ],
    "explanation": "When dealing with negative middle coefficients, remember that both factors need to be negative to give a positive product and negative sum."

    "question": "Why do we need both -4 and -6 to be negative?",
    "options": [
      "To get a negative sum and positive product",
      "To make the math easier",
      "Because the constant term is positive"
