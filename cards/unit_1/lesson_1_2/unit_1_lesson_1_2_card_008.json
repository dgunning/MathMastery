    "problem": "Factor: 2x² + 7x + 3",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: Identify a, b, and c\na = 2, b = 7, c = 3",
      "Step 2: Calculate ac\nac = 2 × 3 = 6",
      "Step 3: Find two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to 7\nFactors of 6: 1×6, 2×3\nCheck: 1 + 6 = 7 ✓\nSo we use 1 and 6",
      "Step 4: Split the middle term using these numbers\n2x² + 7x + 3 = 2x² + 1x + 6x + 3",
      "Step 5: Factor by grouping\n= (2x² + 1x) + (6x + 3)\n= x(2x + 1) + 3(2x + 1)\n= (2x + 1)(x + 3)",
      "Step 6: Check by expanding\n(2x + 1)(x + 3) = 2x² + 6x + x + 3 = 2x² + 7x + 3 ✓"

    "explanation": "Notice how we systematically broke down the problem. The key insight is that splitting 7x into 1x + 6x allows us to group terms that share common factors."
