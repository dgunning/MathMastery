    "problem": "A rectangular garden has a perimeter of 24 meters. If the length of the garden is x meters, express the width as a function of x, and determine the domain and range of this function.",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: Set up an equation using the perimeter formula\nPerimeter = 2(length) + 2(width) = 24\n2x + 2w = 24\nwhere w is the width",
      "Step 2: Solve for w in terms of x\n2w = 24 - 2x\nw = 12 - x\nSo the function is w(x) = 12 - x",
      "Step 3: Determine the domain based on physical constraints\nBoth length and width must be positive: x > 0 and w > 0\nSince w = 12 - x, we need 12 - x > 0\nThis gives us x < 12\nCombining these constraints: 0 < x < 12",
      "Step 4: Determine the range\nSince w = 12 - x and 0 < x < 12\nWhen x approaches 0, w approaches 12\nWhen x approaches 12, w approaches 0\nSo the range is 0 < w < 12"
    ],
    "explanation": "In real-world problems, the domain and range often have practical constraints. For this garden problem, both dimensions must be positive, which restricts both the domain and range."
