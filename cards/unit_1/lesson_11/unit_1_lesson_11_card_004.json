    "explanation": "Vieta's Formulas provide elegant relationships between the coefficients of a polynomial and the sums and products of its roots. For quadratic equations, these formulas are particularly useful for finding equations from their roots or analyzing properties of the roots without solving the equation.\n\nConsider a quadratic equation in standard form:\nax² + bx + c = 0, where a ≠ 0\n\nIf r and s are the two roots of this equation, then Vieta's Formulas state that:\n\n1. r + s = -b/a (Sum of roots)\n2. r × s = c/a (Product of roots)\n\nThese formulas can be derived from the factored form of the quadratic equation:\na(x - r)(x - s) = 0\n\nExpanding this expression:\nax² - a(r + s)x + ars = 0\n\nComparing with the standard form ax² + bx + c = 0, we get:\n-a(r + s) = b, which gives us r + s = -b/a\nars = c, which gives us r × s = c/a\n\nVieta's Formulas work for all types of roots, including real, rational, irrational, and complex roots. They provide a direct connection between the coefficients of the equation and the properties of its roots without requiring us to solve the equation explicitly.",
    "example": "Let's examine a quadratic equation x² - 5x + 6 = 0 and verify Vieta's Formulas.\n\nFirst, we'll solve the equation to find its roots:\nx² - 5x + 6 = 0\n(x - 2)(x - 3) = 0\nx = 2 or x = 3\n\nNow, let's verify Vieta's Formulas:\n\n1. Sum of roots: r + s = 2 + 3 = 5\n   According to Vieta's Formula: r + s = -b/a = -(-5)/1 = 5 ✓\n\n2. Product of roots: r × s = 2 × 3 = 6\n   According to Vieta's Formula: r × s = c/a = 6/1 = 6 ✓\n\nLet's try another example: 2x² + 7x + 3 = 0\n\nUsing Vieta's Formulas directly:\n1. Sum of roots: r + s = -b/a = -7/2\n2. Product of roots: r × s = c/a = 3/2\n\nWe can verify this by solving the equation using the quadratic formula:\nx = (-7 ± √(49 - 24))/4 = (-7 ± √25)/4 = (-7 ± 5)/4\nx = -3 or x = -1/2\n\nIndeed, (-3) + (-1/2) = -7/2 and (-3) × (-1/2) = 3/2, confirming Vieta's Formulas.",
    "key_point": "Vieta's Formulas provide a powerful tool for working with quadratic equations. They allow us to:\n1. Find a quadratic equation when given its roots\n2. Determine properties of the roots (such as their sum and product) without solving the equation\n3. Simplify the process of finding equations with specific root characteristics\n\nRemember the key relationships for a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0 with roots r and s:\n- Sum of roots: r + s = -b/a\n- Product of roots: r × s = c/a"
