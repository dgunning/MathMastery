    "explanation": "Imagine a function as a machine with three parts:\n\n📥 INPUT (Domain): What you put into the machine\n⚙️ PROCESS: What the machine does to transform the input\n📤 OUTPUT (Range): What comes out of the machine\n\nThe special rule: For any given input, the machine ALWAYS produces exactly the same output. It's completely reliable and predictable.",
    "example": "Function machine: f(x) = 2x + 1\n\n• Input 3 → Process: 2(3) + 1 → Output: 7\n• Input 5 → Process: 2(5) + 1 → Output: 11\n• Input 0 → Process: 2(0) + 1 → Output: 1",
    "key_point": "Functions are like reliable machines - same input always gives the same output."

      "Output is 13",
      "Output is 3",
      "Output could be different each time"
