    "problem": "A movie theater finds that when they charge x dollars per ticket, they sell (120 - 5x) tickets per showing. What ticket price will maximize their revenue?",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: Define the revenue function\nRevenue = (Price per ticket) × (Number of tickets sold)\nR(x) = x(120 - 5x) = 120x - 5x²",
      "Step 2: Identify that this is a quadratic function with a < 0, so it has a maximum value\nR(x) = 120x - 5x² = -5x² + 120x, where a = -5, b = 120, c = 0",
      "Step 3: Find the x-coordinate of the vertex using x = -b/(2a)\nx = -(120)/(2(-5)) = 120/10 = 12 dollars",
      "Step 4: Calculate the maximum revenue by evaluating R(12)\nR(12) = 120(12) - 5(12)² = 1440 - 5(144) = 1440 - 720 = $720",
      "Step 5: State the answer\nThe theater should charge $12 per ticket to maximize revenue at $720 per showing"
    ],
    "explanation": "This problem illustrates the economic principle that as price increases, demand typically decreases. The quadratic revenue function captures this relationship, and finding its maximum helps businesses determine optimal pricing strategies."
