  "title": "Advanced Factoring: When Coefficients Aren't 1",
  "duration": 180,
  "content": {
    "explanation": "You've already learned to factor simple trinomials like x² + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3). But what happens when the coefficient in front of x² isn't 1?\n\nFor example: 2x² + 7x + 3\n\nThe '2' in front of x² makes this more challenging because we can't just find two numbers that multiply to give the constant term. We need a new strategy.",
    "example": "Think of it like unpacking a more complex box - you need additional tools when the contents are more complicated.",
    "key_point": "When the leading coefficient (the number in front of x²) is not 1, we need special techniques like the AC method or factoring by grouping."
