  "content": {
    "explanation": "Sometimes expressions look complex, but we can make them simpler by treating certain parts as a single variable. This is called substitution.\n\nFor example, x⁴ - 5x² + 4 looks complicated, but if we let u = x², it becomes:\nu² - 5u + 4\n\nThis is much easier to factor!",
    "example": "Think of substitution like using a nickname for a long name - it makes everything simpler to work with.",
    "key_point": "Substitution transforms complex-looking problems into familiar ones we already know how to solve."

    "question": "If we substitute u = x² in the expression x⁴ + 3x² - 10, what do we get?",

      "u² + 3u - 10",
      "u⁴ + 3u² - 10",
