    "explanation": "The substitution method is a powerful technique for solving linear-quadratic systems because it systematically reduces the problem to a single-variable quadratic equation. Here's a summary of the key steps:\n\n1. Solve the linear equation for one variable (typically y)\n\n2. Substitute this expression into the quadratic equation\n\n3. Solve the resulting quadratic equation using appropriate methods:\n   - Factoring when possible\n   - Quadratic formula for more complex equations\n   - Completing the square when appropriate\n\n4. Find the corresponding values of the second variable\n\n5. Verify all solutions in both original equations\n\nAs demonstrated in the examples, the substitution method can handle various types of linear-quadratic systems, including those with:\n- Integer solutions\n- Fractional solutions\n- Irrational solutions\n\nWhen working with irrational solutions, it's often helpful to keep the exact form (like (3+√57)/4) rather than decimal approximations, especially when verifying solutions."
