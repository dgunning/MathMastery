    "explanation": "Linear-quadratic systems have numerous applications in real-world scenarios. These systems naturally arise when one quantity varies linearly with another, while a second relationship between the same quantities is quadratic. Here are some common applications:\n\n1. Motion Problems\n   - Projectile motion combines constant horizontal velocity (linear) with vertical acceleration due to gravity (quadratic)\n   - Finding when and where a projectile reaches a certain height or hits a sloped surface\n   - Determining intersection points of different motion paths\n\n2. Economics and Business\n   - Revenue functions may be linear while cost functions include both fixed costs and variable costs with economies of scale (quadratic)\n   - Finding break-even points where revenue equals cost\n   - Determining optimal production levels for maximum profit\n\n3. Geometry Problems\n   - Finding points where a line intersects a parabolic curve\n   - Determining dimensions that satisfy both area and perimeter constraints\n   - Solving problems involving distance and geometric relationships\n\n4. Physics Applications\n   - Light refraction through different media\n   - Electrical circuits with both linear and quadratic components\n   - Mechanical systems with springs and dampers\n\n5. Optimization Problems\n   - Maximizing area for a given perimeter\n   - Minimizing cost for a given output\n   - Finding optimal dimensions or parameters\n\nWhen solving real-world problems using linear-quadratic systems:\n\n1. Identify the variables and what they represent\n2. Set up the linear and quadratic equations based on the given conditions\n3. Solve the system using appropriate methods (substitution, elimination, graphical)\n4. Interpret the solutions in the context of the original problem\n5. Check if the solutions make sense in the real-world context (e.g., negative values might not be valid)",
    "example": "Example 1: Projectile Motion\n\nA ball is thrown from the top of a 64-foot building with an initial velocity of 16 feet per second. At the same time, a person on the ground throws another ball upward with an initial velocity of 80 feet per second. When will the two balls be at the same height?\n\nSolution:\nFor the first ball (thrown from the building):\nh₁ = 64 + 16t - 16t²\n\nFor the second ball (thrown from the ground):\nh₂ = 80t - 16t²\n\nWhen the balls are at the same height, h₁ = h₂:\n64 + 16t - 16t² = 80t - 16t²\n64 = 64t\nt = 1\n\nAt t = 1 second, both balls will be at the same height. We can find this height by substituting t = 1 into either equation:\nh = 64 + 16(1) - 16(1)² = 64 + 16 - 16 = 64 feet\n\nExample 2: Business Application\n\nA company produces x items with a cost function C(x) = 2x² + 30x + 500 and a revenue function R(x) = 150x. How many items should be produced to break even (revenue equals cost)?\n\nSolution:\nAt the break-even point, R(x) = C(x):\n150x = 2x² + 30x + 500\n0 = 2x² - 120x + 500\n0 = x² - 60x + 250\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\nx = (60 ± √(3600 - 1000))/2 = (60 ± √2600)/2 = (60 ± 51)/2\n\nx ≈ 55.5 or x ≈ 4.5\n\nSince we can only produce a whole number of items, and considering the context, the company needs to produce at least 56 items to start making a profit. At 5 items, the company would also break even, but would start losing money with more production until reaching 56 items.\n\nExample 3: Geometry Problem\n\nA rectangular garden has a perimeter of 30 meters. A diagonal path across the garden is 12.5 meters long. Find the dimensions of the garden.\n\nSolution:\nLet x be the length and y be the width of the garden.\n\nFrom the perimeter: 2x + 2y = 30, so y = 15 - x\n\nFrom the diagonal (using the Pythagorean theorem): x² + y² = 12.5²\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second:\nx² + (15 - x)² = 156.25\nx² + 225 - 30x + x² = 156.25\n2x² - 30x + 68.75 = 0\nx² - 15x + 34.375 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\nx = (15 ± √(225 - 137.5))/2 = (15 ± √87.5)/2 ≈ (15 ± 9.35)/2\n\nx ≈ 12.18 or x ≈ 2.82\n\nIf x ≈ 12.18, then y ≈ 2.82\nIf x ≈ 2.82, then y ≈ 12.18\n\nThe garden is either approximately 12.18 meters by 2.82 meters or 2.82 meters by 12.18 meters (the same rectangle with length and width reversed).",
    "key_point": "When applying linear-quadratic systems to real-world problems:\n\n1. Carefully define your variables and what they represent in the context of the problem\n\n2. Ensure that the units are consistent throughout your calculations\n\n3. Consider the domain restrictions based on the physical context:\n   - Time is usually non-negative\n   - Physical dimensions cannot be negative\n   - Quantities like production numbers are often whole numbers\n\n4. When multiple solutions are found, analyze each one to determine which are valid in the context of the problem\n\n5. Always verify your solutions by checking that they satisfy the original conditions of the problem\n\n6. Be aware that real-world problems often have constraints that may eliminate some mathematically valid solutions"
