    "problem": "Solve the following quadratic equations by factoring:\n1. x² - 7x + 12 = 0\n2. x² - 9 = 0\n3. x² + 6x = 0",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: For x² - 7x + 12 = 0, we need to find two numbers that multiply to give 12 and add to give -7.\nThe factors of 12 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.\nThe pairs are: (1,12), (2,6), and (3,4).\nChecking the sums: 1 + 12 = 13, 2 + 6 = 8, 3 + 4 = 7.\nSince we need a sum of -7, we need negative factors: (-3)(-4) = 12 and -3 + (-4) = -7.",
      "Step 2: Factor the equation using these values.\nx² - 7x + 12 = 0\n(x - 3)(x - 4) = 0",
      "Step 3: Apply the zero product property: if (x - 3)(x - 4) = 0, then either (x - 3) = 0 or (x - 4) = 0.\nx - 3 = 0 → x = 3\nx - 4 = 0 → x = 4\nSo the solutions are x = 3 or x = 4.",
      "Step 4: For x² - 9 = 0, recognize this as a difference of squares: a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b).\nx² - 9 = 0\nx² - 3² = 0\n(x + 3)(x - 3) = 0",
      "Step 5: Apply the zero product property.\nx + 3 = 0 → x = -3\nx - 3 = 0 → x = 3\nSo the solutions are x = -3 or x = 3.",
      "Step 6: For x² + 6x = 0, factor out the common factor x.\nx² + 6x = 0\nx(x + 6) = 0",
      "Step 7: Apply the zero product property.\nx = 0 or x + 6 = 0\nx = 0 or x = -6\nSo the solutions are x = 0 or x = -6."
    ],
    "explanation": "The factoring method for solving quadratic equations relies on the zero product property, which states that if a product equals zero, then at least one of the factors must be zero.\n\nKey factoring patterns to recognize:\n1. Common factor: ax² + bx = x(ax + b)\n2. Difference of squares: a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b)\n3. Perfect square trinomial: a² + 2ab + b² = (a + b)²\n4. General trinomial: ax² + bx + c = (px + q)(rx + s) where pr = a and qs = c and ps + qr = b\n\nOnce the equation is factored, set each factor equal to zero and solve for the variable."
