    "explanation": "Let's practice with function notation using a real scenario.\n\nImagine: P(t) = 20t + 100 represents your gaming points, where t is hours played.\n\nThis means: 'Points equals 20 times hours played, plus 100 starting points'",
    "example": "üéÆ Finding outputs:\n\nStep 1: P(0) = 20(0) + 100 = 100 points (starting points)\nStep 2: P(5) = 20(5) + 100 = 200 points (after 5 hours)\nStep 3: P(10) = 20(10) + 100 = 300 points (after 10 hours)\n\nüîç Finding inputs:\nIf P(t) = 180, what is t?\n180 = 20t + 100\n80 = 20t\nt = 4 hours",
    "key_point": "Substitute the input value for the variable, then solve using order of operations."
