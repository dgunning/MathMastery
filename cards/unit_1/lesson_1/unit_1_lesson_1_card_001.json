    "explanation": "Welcome to the world of functions! Functions are everywhere in your daily life, even if you don't realize it.\n\nThink about your smartphone: when you tap an app icon, your phone always opens that specific app. When you press the volume up button, the volume increases. Each action (input) produces a predictable result (output).\n\nThis predictable relationship between inputs and outputs is what we call a function in mathematics.",
    "example": "ðŸŽ® Video game controller:\nâ€¢ Press A â†’ Character jumps\nâ€¢ Press B â†’ Character runs\nâ€¢ Press X â†’ Character attacks\n\nEach button always does the same thing!",
    "key_point": "A function is a relationship where each input gives exactly one output."
