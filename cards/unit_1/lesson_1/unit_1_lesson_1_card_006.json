    "explanation": "The RANGE is the complete set of all possible output values (y-values) that a function can produce.\n\nThink of range like what actually comes out of a vending machine:\nðŸ¥¤ The range is all the drinks/snacks you might actually get\nðŸ“¦ Even if the machine has 50 slots, maybe only 30 have products\n\nThe range depends on both the function's rule AND its domain. A function might be capable of producing many values, but only produces certain ones based on what you put in.",
    "example": "ðŸŽ® Gaming examples:\nâ€¢ Character level function: Range might be 1 to 60\nâ€¢ Health points: 0 to 100 HP\nâ€¢ Score multiplier: 1x to 10x\nâ€¢ Jump height: 1 to 5 blocks",
    "key_point": "Range = all y-values the function actually produces."
