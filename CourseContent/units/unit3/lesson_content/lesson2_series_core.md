# Series: Parent Teaching Guide

## What You're Teaching

This guide helps you teach your teenager about series, which are the sums of sequence terms. Series are fundamental in discrete mathematics and have applications in finance, physics, and many other fields.

## Key Concepts to Cover

### 1. Understanding Series

**Simple explanation:** "A series is the sum of some or all terms in a sequence. While a sequence is a list of numbers, a series is the result of adding those numbers together."

**Key terminology:**
- **Series:** Sum of sequence terms
- **Partial sum:** Sum of a finite number of terms
- **Infinite series:** Sum of all terms in an infinite sequence
- **Convergent series:** Infinite series with a finite sum
- **Divergent series:** Infinite series without a finite sum

**Notation:**
- Standard notation: a₁ + a₂ + a₃ + ... + aₙ
- Sigma notation: Σ(from i=1 to n) aᵢ

**Example:**
"For the sequence {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...}:
- The series of the first 5 terms is 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30
- Using sigma notation: Σ(from i=1 to 5) 2i = 30"

### 2. Arithmetic Series

**Simple explanation:** "An arithmetic series is the sum of terms in an arithmetic sequence, where each term differs from the previous by a constant value."

**Sum formula:**
- Sum of first n terms: Sₙ = n/2 × [2a₁ + (n-1)d]
- Alternative form: Sₙ = n/2 × (a₁ + aₙ) = n/2 × (first term + last term)

**Derivation insight:**
"The formula can be understood by pairing terms from opposite ends:
- S₅ = 3 + 7 + 11 + 15 + 19
- S₅ = (3 + 19) + (7 + 15) + 11
- S₅ = 22 + 22 + 22/2 = 5/2 × 22 = 55"

**Example calculation:**
"Find the sum of the first 20 terms of the arithmetic sequence {5, 8, 11, 14, ...}:
- a₁ = 5, d = 3
- a₂₀ = 5 + (20-1)3 = 5 + 57 = 62
- S₂₀ = 20/2 × (5 + 62) = 10 × 67 = 670"

**Applications:**
- Sum of consecutive integers: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2
- Sum of consecutive even/odd numbers
- Calculating total distance traveled with constant acceleration

### 3. Geometric Series

**Simple explanation:** "A geometric series is the sum of terms in a geometric sequence, where each term is multiplied by a constant ratio to get the next term."

**Sum formula:**
- Sum of first n terms: Sₙ = a₁(1-rⁿ)/(1-r), where r ≠ 1
- If r = 1, then Sₙ = na₁

**Derivation insight:**
"The formula can be derived by a clever algebraic trick:
- Let S = a + ar + ar² + ... + arⁿ⁻¹
- Multiply by r: Sr = ar + ar² + ... + arⁿ
- Subtract: S - Sr = a - arⁿ
- Factor: S(1-r) = a(1-rⁿ)
- Solve for S: S = a(1-rⁿ)/(1-r)"

**Example calculation:**
"Find the sum of the first 6 terms of the geometric sequence {3, 6, 12, 24, ...}:
- a₁ = 3, r = 2
- S₆ = 3(1-2⁶)/(1-2) = 3(1-64)/(-1) = 3 × 63 = 189"

**Applications:**
- Compound interest calculations
- Bouncing ball problems (total distance traveled)
- Calculating present value of annuities

### 4. Infinite Geometric Series

**Simple explanation:** "An infinite geometric series is the sum of all terms in an infinite geometric sequence. Surprisingly, this can have a finite sum if the common ratio has an absolute value less than 1."

**Convergence condition:**
- Series converges if |r| < 1
- Series diverges if |r| ≥ 1

**Sum formula for convergent series:**
- S∞ = a₁/(1-r) when |r| < 1

**Derivation insight:**
"As n approaches infinity in the formula Sₙ = a₁(1-rⁿ)/(1-r), the term rⁿ approaches 0 when |r| < 1, giving us S∞ = a₁/(1-r)."

**Example calculation:**
"Find the sum of the infinite geometric series 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 + ...:
- a₁ = 8, r = 1/2
- Since |r| = 1/2 < 1, the series converges
- S∞ = 8/(1-1/2) = 8/0.5 = 16"

**Applications:**
- Repeating decimals (e.g., 0.999... = 9/9 = 1)
- Zeno's paradoxes
- Fractal patterns

### 5. Sigma Notation

**Simple explanation:** "Sigma notation is a compact way to write series using the Greek letter Σ (sigma). It specifies the starting and ending indices and the formula for each term."

**Format:**
- Σ(from i=m to n) f(i) = f(m) + f(m+1) + ... + f(n)

**Common properties:**
- Σ(from i=m to n) c = c(n-m+1) [sum of constants]
- Σ(from i=m to n) [af(i) + bg(i)] = aΣf(i) + bΣg(i) [linearity]

**Example calculations:**
"Evaluate Σ(from i=1 to 5) (3i - 2):
- (3×1-2) + (3×2-2) + (3×3-2) + (3×4-2) + (3×5-2)
- 1 + 4 + 7 + 10 + 13 = 35"

"Evaluate Σ(from i=0 to 4) 2ⁱ:
- 2⁰ + 2¹ + 2² + 2³ + 2⁴
- 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31"

### 6. Applications of Series

**Simple explanation:** "Series have many real-world applications in finance, physics, probability, and other fields."

**Financial applications:**
1. **Regular savings:**
   - Monthly deposits of $200 for 5 years at 6% annual interest
   - Each deposit grows according to compound interest
   - Total = $200 × [(1.005)⁶⁰-1]/0.005 ≈ $13,954

2. **Loan payments:**
   - Present value of fixed payments
   - Mortgage calculations

**Physics applications:**
1. **Total distance traveled:**
   - Bouncing ball: Initial height + sum of all up and down distances
   - Example: 2m ball that rebounds to 60% of height each time

2. **Center of mass calculations:**
   - Weighted averages using series

**Probability applications:**
1. **Expected value:**
   - Sum of all possible outcomes weighted by probabilities

2. **Infinite trials:**
   - Probability of at least one success in infinite trials

### 7. Problem-Solving Strategies

**Simple explanation:** "When working with series problems, use these strategies to identify the type of series and apply the appropriate formula."

**Identification steps:**
1. Determine if the sequence is arithmetic, geometric, or neither
2. For arithmetic: find first term (a₁) and common difference (d)
3. For geometric: find first term (a₁) and common ratio (r)
4. Decide if you need a partial sum or infinite sum
5. Apply the appropriate formula

**Common problem types:**
1. **Finding the sum given terms:**
   - Identify the pattern, find a₁ and d or r, apply formula

2. **Finding the number of terms given the sum:**
   - Substitute known values into sum formula and solve for n

3. **Finding a specific term in a sequence given the sum:**
   - Use the relationship between sequence and series

4. **Word problems:**
   - Translate the problem into mathematical notation
   - Identify the type of series
   - Apply appropriate formulas

## Common Misconceptions and How to Address Them

1. **"All infinite series have an infinite sum"**
   - Clarification: "Only some infinite series diverge to infinity. Infinite geometric series with |r| < 1 converge to a finite sum."

2. **"The sum formula works for all types of series"**
   - Clarification: "Different types of series have different sum formulas. The arithmetic and geometric formulas only work for their specific sequence types."

3. **"You always need to add all terms to find the sum"**
   - Clarification: "The power of series formulas is that they let us find sums without adding each term individually."

4. **"Arithmetic and geometric are the only types of series"**
   - Clarification: "There are many other types of series, like telescoping series, power series, and Taylor series, which you'll study in calculus."

7. You deposit $300 at the end of each month into an account paying 6% annual interest compounded monthly. How much will you have after 4 years?

8. Find the sum of all multiples of 3 between 1 and 100.

**Solutions:**

1. Arithmetic sequence with a₁ = 4, d = 5
   S₁₅ = 15/2 × [2(4) + (15-1)5]
   S₁₅ = 7.5 × [8 + 70]
   S₁₅ = 7.5 × 78 = 585

2. Geometric series with a₁ = 5, r = 3, n = 8
   S₈ = 5(1-3⁸)/(1-3)
   S₈ = 5(1-6561)/(-2)
   S₈ = 5 × 6560/2 = 16,400

3. Geometric series with a₁ = 64, r = 1/4
   Since |r| = 1/4 < 1, the series converges
   S∞ = 64/(1-1/4) = 64/0.75 = 85.33

4. For arithmetic sequence with a₁ = 7, d = 4:
   Sₙ = n/2 × [2(7) + (n-1)4]
   Sₙ = n/2 × [14 + 4n - 4]
   Sₙ = n/2 × [10 + 4n]
   Sₙ = 5n + 2n²
   Solve: 5n + 2n² > 500
   Using quadratic formula or trial and error: n ≥ 15

5. Σ(from i=1 to 10) (i² - 2i)
   = Σi² - 2Σi
   = [10(10+1)(2×10+1)/6] - 2[10(10+1)/2]
   = [10×11×21/6] - [10×11]
   = 385 - 110 = 275

6. Initial drop: 5m
   First bounce up and down: 2 × 0.7 × 5 = 7m
   Second bounce up and down: 2 × 0.7² × 5 = 4.9m
   Total distance = 5 + 2 × 5 × 0.7(1 + 0.7 + 0.7² + ...)
   = 5 + 2 × 5 × 0.7/(1-0.7)
   = 5 + 10 × 0.7/0.3
   = 5 + 10 × 2.33
   = 5 + 23.33 = 28.33m

7. Monthly interest rate = 0.06/12 = 0.005
   Number of deposits = 4 × 12 = 48
   Future value = 300 × [(1.005)⁴⁸-1]/0.005
   = 300 × [1.27-1]/0.005
   = 300 × 0.27/0.005
   = 300 × 54 = $16,200

8. Multiples of 3 between 1 and 100: 3, 6, 9, ..., 99
   This is an arithmetic sequence with a₁ = 3, d = 3, last term = 99
   Number of terms = (99-3)/3 + 1 = 33
   S₃₃ = 33/2 × (3 + 99) = 33/2 × 102 = 1,683
