# Recursive Functions: Parent Teaching Guide (Core Version)

## What You're Teaching

This guide helps you teach your teenager about recursive functions, which are functions that refer to themselves in their definition. This powerful mathematical concept builds on the sequence knowledge from previous lessons and is essential for understanding many patterns in mathematics and computer science.

## Key Concepts to Cover

### 1. Understanding Recursion

**Simple explanation:** "A recursive function is one that uses its own previous outputs to calculate new outputs. It's like a mathematical version of 'to understand this step, you need to understand the previous step.'"

**Key concepts:**
- Recursion involves defining something in terms of itself
- Requires initial conditions (base cases) to start the process
- Can often solve problems that are difficult to express directly

**Real-world analogies:**
- "Recursion is like looking at yourself in a mirror that reflects another mirror - you see infinite reflections."
- "It's like following a recipe that says 'to make sauce, first make a smaller batch of the same sauce.'"
- "Think of nested Russian dolls, where each doll contains a smaller version of itself."

### 2. Recursive Sequences

**Simple explanation:** "A recursive sequence is defined by explaining how to get from one term to the next, rather than giving a direct formula for any term."

**Key components:**
1. **Initial term(s):** Starting value(s) for the sequence
2. **Recursive formula:** Rule for finding the next term using previous terms

**Common examples:**
1. **Arithmetic sequence recursively:**
   - a₁ = 3
   - aₙ₊₁ = aₙ + 4
   - Generates: 3, 7, 11, 15, ...

2. **Geometric sequence recursively:**
   - a₁ = 2
   - aₙ₊₁ = aₙ × 3
   - Generates: 2, 6, 18, 54, ...

3. **Fibonacci sequence:**
   - a₁ = 1, a₂ = 1
   - aₙ₊₂ = aₙ₊₁ + aₙ
   - Generates: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...

**Converting between forms:**
"Some sequences can be written both recursively and explicitly:
- Arithmetic: aₙ₊₁ = aₙ + d ⟷ aₙ = a₁ + (n-1)d
- Geometric: aₙ₊₁ = aₙ × r ⟷ aₙ = a₁ × r^(n-1)
- Others (like Fibonacci) have complex explicit forms"

### 3. Recursive Functions

**Simple explanation:** "A recursive function is similar to a recursive sequence, but allows us to calculate values for any input, not just sequential integers."

**Key components:**
1. **Base case(s):** Specific input value(s) with defined outputs
2. **Recursive case:** Formula relating f(x) to f of other values

**Examples of recursive functions:**
1. **Factorial function:**
   - Base case: 0! = 1
   - Recursive case: n! = n × (n-1)! for n > 0
   - Example: 4! = 4 × 3! = 4 × 3 × 2! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24

2. **Greatest common divisor (GCD):**
   - Base case: gcd(a, 0) = a
   - Recursive case: gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a mod b) for b > 0
   - Example: gcd(48, 18) = gcd(18, 12) = gcd(12, 6) = gcd(6, 0) = 6

3. **Power function:**
   - Base case: x⁰ = 1
   - Recursive case: x^n = x × x^(n-1) for n > 0
   - Example: 2³ = 2 × 2² = 2 × 2 × 2¹ = 2 × 2 × 2 = 8

### 4. Analyzing Recursive Definitions

**Simple explanation:** "We can analyze recursive definitions to understand patterns, find explicit formulas, and determine long-term behavior."

**Analysis techniques:**
1. **Unraveling recursion:**
   - Work through several iterations to identify patterns
   - Example: T(n) = T(n-1) + n with T(1) = 1
     - T(2) = T(1) + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3
     - T(3) = T(2) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6
     - T(4) = T(3) + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
     - Pattern: T(n) = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2

2. **Recurrence relations:**
   - Linear recurrence relations can often be solved for explicit formulas
   - Example: aₙ = 3aₙ₋₁ - 2aₙ₋₂ with a₁ = 1, a₂ = 3
     - Characteristic equation: r² - 3r + 2 = 0
     - Roots: r = 1, r = 2
     - General solution: aₙ = c₁(1)^n + c₂(2)^n = c₁ + c₂(2)^n
     - Using initial conditions: a₁ = c₁ + 2c₂ = 1, a₂ = c₁ + 4c₂ = 3
     - Solving: c₁ = 0, c₂ = 1/2
     - Explicit formula: aₙ = (2^n)/2 = 2^(n-1)

3. **Convergence analysis:**
   - Determine if recursive sequences approach a limit
   - Example: xₙ₊₁ = (xₙ + 5)/2 with x₁ = 0
     - If sequence converges to L, then L = (L + 5)/2
     - Solving: L = 5
     - Verify: 0, 2.5, 3.75, 4.375, 4.6875, ... → 5

### 5. Applications of Recursive Functions

**Simple explanation:** "Recursive functions have many practical applications in mathematics, computer science, and real-world problem-solving."

**Key applications:**
1. **Mathematical modeling:**
   - Population growth: P(n+1) = P(n) + r·P(n)
   - Compound interest: A(n+1) = A(n) + r·A(n)
   - Radioactive decay: A(n+1) = A(n) - k·A(n)

2. **Computer algorithms:**
   - Searching and sorting (binary search, merge sort)
   - Tree and graph traversal
   - Divide-and-conquer strategies

3. **Problem-solving:**
   - Tower of Hanoi puzzle
   - Fractal generation
   - Dynamic programming

**Example application:**
"A bank account starts with $1000 and earns 5% interest annually. Additionally, $200 is deposited at the end of each year. The recursive function for the balance after n years is:
- B(0) = 1000
- B(n) = 1.05 × B(n-1) + 200 for n ≥ 1

Let's calculate the first few values:
- B(0) = 1000
- B(1) = 1.05 × 1000 + 200 = 1250
- B(2) = 1.05 × 1250 + 200 = 1512.50
- B(3) = 1.05 × 1512.50 + 200 = 1788.13"

### 6. Recursive Thinking and Problem-Solving

**Simple explanation:** "Recursive thinking is a powerful problem-solving approach where we break down complex problems into simpler versions of the same problem."

**Key strategies:**
1. **Identify the base case(s):**
   - Simplest version(s) of the problem with known solutions

2. **Define the recursive relationship:**
   - How to express the solution in terms of simpler cases

3. **Trust the recursion:**
   - Assume the recursive calls work correctly
   - Focus on combining their results properly

**Example problem-solving:**
"To find the sum of the first n positive integers recursively:
1. Base case: sum(1) = 1
2. Recursive case: sum(n) = n + sum(n-1) for n > 1
3. Example: sum(4) = 4 + sum(3) = 4 + (3 + sum(2)) = 4 + 3 + (2 + sum(1)) = 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10"

## Common Misconceptions and How to Address Them

1. **"Recursion always leads to infinite loops"**
   - Clarification: "Properly designed recursive functions include base cases that stop the recursion."

2. **"Recursive solutions are always more complex than non-recursive ones"**
   - Clarification: "For many problems, recursive solutions are actually more elegant and intuitive."

3. **"You can always easily convert between recursive and explicit formulas"**
   - Clarification: "Some recursive relationships have very complex explicit formulas or no closed form at all."

4. **"Recursion is only useful in computer programming"**
   - Clarification: "Recursive thinking is valuable in many areas of mathematics and problem-solving."

5. **"All recursive sequences converge to a limit"**
   - Clarification: "Many recursive sequences diverge or oscillate rather than approaching a single value."

## Check for Understanding

After covering the material, ask these questions:
1. "What are the essential components of a recursive definition?"
2. "How is a recursive sequence different from an explicit sequence?"
3. "Can you give an example of a recursive function we use in everyday life?"
4. "Why is it important to have a base case in recursion?"
5. "How might you approach converting a recursive definition to an explicit one?"

## Practice Problems

1. Write recursive definitions for the following sequences:
   a) 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...
   b) 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, ...
   c) 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...
   d) 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...

2. Find the first five terms of each recursively defined sequence:
   a) a₁ = 2, aₙ₊₁ = 3aₙ - 1
   b) a₁ = 1, a₂ = 3, aₙ₊₂ = 2aₙ₊₁ - aₙ
   c) a₁ = 1, aₙ₊₁ = n × aₙ

3. Convert these recursive definitions to explicit formulas:
   a) a₁ = 5, aₙ₊₁ = aₙ + 3
   b) a₁ = 2, aₙ₊₁ = 2aₙ
   c) a₁ = 4, aₙ₊₁ = -aₙ

4. Analyze the long-term behavior of these recursive sequences:
   a) xₙ₊₁ = (xₙ + 10)/2 with x₁ = 0
   b) xₙ₊₁ = 0.9xₙ with x₁ = 100
   c) xₙ₊₁ = xₙ² - 1 with x₁ = 0.5

5. Solve these recursive problems:
   a) A ball bounces to 3/4 of its previous height after each bounce. If it is dropped from 16 meters, what height will it reach after the 5th bounce?
   b) A population grows by 8% each year. If the initial population is 1000, write a recursive function for the population after n years and find the population after 10 years.
   c) A savings account starts with $2000 and earns 4% interest annually. If $500 is withdrawn at the end of each year, write a recursive function for the balance after n years and determine when the account will be depleted.

**Solutions:**

1. a) a₁ = 2, aₙ₊₁ = 2aₙ
   b) a₁ = 3, aₙ₊₁ = aₙ + 4
   c) a₁ = 1, aₙ₊₁ = aₙ + 2n + 1 (or recognize as perfect squares: aₙ = n²)
   d) a₁ = 1, aₙ₊₁ = aₙ + n + 1 (triangular numbers: aₙ = n(n+1)/2)

2. a) 2, 5, 14, 41, 122
   b) 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 (linear sequence)
   c) 1, 1, 2, 6, 24 (factorial sequence: aₙ = n!)

3. a) aₙ = 5 + 3(n-1) = 3n + 2
   b) aₙ = 2 × 2^(n-1) = 2^n
   c) aₙ = 4 × (-1)^(n-1) (alternating sequence)

4. a) Converges to 10 (solve xₙ₊₁ = xₙ to find fixed point)
   b) Converges to 0 (geometric sequence with |r| < 1)
   c) Does not converge (chaotic behavior)

5. a) h₅ = 16 × (3/4)^5 ≈ 4.75 meters
   b) P(n) = 1000 × (1.08)^n, P(10) ≈ 2159 people
   c) B(0) = 2000, B(n) = 1.04 × B(n-1) - 500
      B(1) = 1.04 × 2000 - 500 = 1580
      B(2) = 1.04 × 1580 - 500 = 1143.20
      B(3) = 1.04 × 1143.20 - 500 = 688.93
      B(4) = 1.04 × 688.93 - 500 = 216.49
      B(5) = 1.04 × 216.49 - 500 = -274.85
      Account depleted during the 5th year
