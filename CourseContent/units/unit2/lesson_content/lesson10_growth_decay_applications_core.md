# Growth and Decay Applications: Parent Teaching Guide

## What You're Teaching

This guide helps you teach your teenager about diverse applications of exponential growth and decay beyond basic financial and radioactive decay models. These applications demonstrate the wide-ranging importance of exponential functions in scientific research, social phenomena, and technological development.

## Key Concepts to Cover

### 1. The Generalized Growth and Decay Model

**Simple explanation:** "Exponential functions can model many different types of growth and decay phenomena using the general form P(t) = P₀·e^(kt), where k is a constant that determines whether there is growth (k > 0) or decay (k < 0)."

**Key forms:**
- Continuous growth/decay: P(t) = P₀·e^(kt)
- Discrete growth/decay: P(t) = P₀·(1+r)^t or P(t) = P₀·(1-r)^t
- Mixed models: P(t) = P₀·e^(kt) + c (with horizontal asymptote at y = c)

**Variables and parameters:**
- P₀: Initial amount or value
- k: Continuous growth/decay rate
- r: Discrete growth/decay rate per time period
- t: Time elapsed
- P(t): Amount at time t

**Relationship between discrete and continuous rates:**
- For small rates: r ≈ k
- More precisely: e^k = 1+r
- Therefore: k = ln(1+r) and r = e^k - 1

### 2. Population Growth Models

**Simple explanation:** "Population growth often follows exponential patterns, especially when resources are abundant. However, real populations eventually face limiting factors that change the growth pattern."

**Unconstrained population growth:**
- P(t) = P₀·e^(kt)
- Assumes unlimited resources and space
- Accurate only for early stages of growth

**Logistic growth model:**
- P(t) = K / (1 + ((K-P₀)/P₀)·e^(-rt))
- K represents carrying capacity (maximum sustainable population)
- Growth slows as population approaches carrying capacity

**Example application:**
"A bacterial culture starts with 500 cells and grows at a rate of 15% per hour in a petri dish with a carrying capacity of 25,000 cells.
- Initial unconstrained growth: P(t) = 500·e^(0.15t)
- As the population grows, resources become limited
- Logistic model: P(t) = 25000 / (1 + ((25000-500)/500)·e^(-0.15t))
- After 24 hours, unconstrained model predicts ~48,000 cells (unrealistic)
- Logistic model predicts ~18,400 cells (approaching but not exceeding capacity)"

**Visual insight:** "The logistic curve starts exponential but then S-curves and levels off at carrying capacity, creating a horizontal asymptote."

### 3. Epidemiological Models

**Simple explanation:** "The spread of diseases can follow exponential patterns, especially in the early stages of an outbreak."

**Basic SIR model components:**
- Susceptible (S): People who can catch the disease
- Infectious (I): People who have the disease and can spread it
- Recovered/Removed (R): People who had the disease and are now immune or deceased

**Early-stage epidemic growth:**
- I(t) = I₀·e^(rt) (where r is the effective transmission rate)
- Applies only during initial outbreak when S ≈ total population

**Key epidemic parameters:**
- R₀ (basic reproduction number): Average number of new infections caused by each infected person
- When R₀ > 1: Exponential growth of infections
- When R₀ < 1: Exponential decay of infections

**Example calculation:**
"In the early stage of an outbreak with R₀ = 2.5 and an average infection duration of 14 days:
- Growth rate r = (R₀-1)/infection duration = (2.5-1)/14 ≈ 0.107
- If 10 people are initially infected, after 30 days: I(30) = 10·e^(0.107×30) ≈ 10·25.7 ≈ 257 cases
- This early exponential model becomes invalid once a significant portion of the population is infected or recovered"

### 4. Carbon Dating and Archaeological Applications

**Simple explanation:** "Carbon dating uses the exponential decay of carbon-14 to determine the age of organic artifacts."

**Carbon-14 dating process:**
1. Living organisms maintain a constant ratio of C-14 to C-12
2. When an organism dies, it stops absorbing new carbon
3. C-14 decays exponentially with a half-life of approximately 5,730 years
4. By measuring the current ratio of C-14 to C-12, we can determine when the organism died

**Age determination formula:**
- t = -(5730/ln(2))·ln(P/P₀)
- t: Age of the sample in years
- P/P₀: Fraction of original C-14 remaining

**Example calculation:**
"An ancient wooden tool has 35% of the expected C-14 content:
- t = -(5730/ln(2))·ln(0.35)
- t = -8267·(-1.05)
- t ≈ 8,680 years old"

**Other radioactive dating methods:**
- Potassium-40/Argon-40: Half-life 1.25 billion years (ancient rocks)
- Uranium-238/Lead-206: Half-life 4.5 billion years (Earth's age)
- Uranium-235/Lead-207: Half-life 704 million years (meteorites)

### 5. Environmental Applications

**Simple explanation:** "Exponential models help us understand environmental processes like pollution dispersion, carbon absorption, and species decline."

**Environmental decay applications:**
1. **Pollutant degradation:**
   - C(t) = C₀·e^(-kt)
   - C₀: Initial concentration
   - k: Decay constant
   - Example: Some pesticides degrade exponentially in soil

2. **Species decline due to habitat loss:**
   - N(t) = N₀·e^(-kt)
   - N₀: Initial population
   - k: Extinction rate
   - Example: Certain rainforest species declining as forest area decreases

3. **Atmospheric carbon dioxide increase:**
   - C(t) = C₀·e^(kt) (pre-industrial era to present)
   - C₀: Pre-industrial CO₂ concentration (~280 ppm)
   - k: Growth rate (approximately 0.005 per year)
   - Example: CO₂ levels have risen from ~280 ppm to ~415 ppm over ~150 years

**Example problem:**
"A lake is contaminated with 200 mg/L of a chemical that degrades at 12% per month. How long until the concentration drops below the safe level of 10 mg/L?
- 10 = 200·e^(-0.12t)
- 0.05 = e^(-0.12t)
- -0.12t = ln(0.05)
- t = -ln(0.05)/0.12 ≈ 25 months"

### 6. Drug Absorption and Elimination

**Simple explanation:** "Medications in the body follow exponential patterns for both absorption into the bloodstream and elimination from the body."

**Pharmacokinetic models:**
1. **One-compartment model:**
   - C(t) = C₀·e^(-kt)
   - C₀: Initial concentration
   - k: Elimination rate constant
   - t₁/₂ = ln(2)/k: Half-life of the drug

2. **IV bolus with elimination:**
   - C(t) = (Dose/V)·e^(-kt)
   - V: Volume of distribution
   - k: Elimination rate constant

3. **Multiple dosing:**
   - C(t) = (Dose/V)·e^(-kt) + (Dose/V)·e^(-k(t-τ)) + ...
   - τ: Dosing interval

**Example application:**
"A medication with an elimination half-life of 8 hours is administered as 100 mg IV bolus:
- Concentration after one half-life (8 hours): 50 mg
- Concentration after two half-lives (16 hours): 25 mg
- Concentration after three half-lives (24 hours): 12.5 mg
- For medications with short half-lives, multiple daily doses are needed to maintain therapeutic levels"

**Medical insight:** "Understanding drug half-life helps determine appropriate dosing schedules and explains why some medications must be taken multiple times per day while others only once."

### 7. Technology Adoption and Social Media Growth

**Simple explanation:** "The spread of new technologies and social media platforms often follows exponential patterns during their growth phases."

**Technology adoption S-curve:**
- Initial exponential growth (early adopters)
- Continued exponential growth (mass market)
- Saturation and slowing (market saturation)
- Logistic function: P(t) = K / (1 + a·e^(-bt))
- K: Maximum market size
- a, b: Constants determining shape and speed

**Network effect:**
- Value of network increases exponentially with number of users
- Metcalfe's Law: Value ∝ n²
- Reed's Law: Value ∝ 2^n

**Example:**
"Facebook grew from 1 million users in 2004 to over 100 million by 2008:
- Early growth approximated by U(t) = U₀·e^(kt)
- U₀ = 1 million, U(4) = 100 million
- 100 = 1·e^(4k)
- 4k = ln(100) = 4.6
- k ≈ 1.15
- This represents 115% growth rate per year during this period
- Growth eventually slowed as market saturation was reached"

### 8. Sound Intensity and Earthquake Magnitude

**Simple explanation:** "Both sound intensity and earthquake magnitude are measured on logarithmic scales because they represent phenomena that span enormous ranges of intensity."

**Decibel scale for sound:**
- dB = 10·log₁₀(I/I₀)
- I: Sound intensity
- I₀: Reference intensity (hearing threshold)
- An increase of 10 dB represents 10× the intensity
- An increase of 20 dB represents 100× the intensity

**Richter scale for earthquakes:**
- M = log₁₀(A/A₀)
- A: Amplitude measured on seismograph
- A₀: Reference amplitude
- An increase of 1 on Richter scale ≈ 10× the amplitude and 31.6× the energy
- An increase of 2 ≈ 100× the amplitude and 1000× the energy

**Example calculation:**
"An earthquake measures 7.0 on the Richter scale. How much more powerful is it than a 5.0 earthquake?
- Amplitude ratio: 10^(7.0-5.0) = 10^2 = 100 times greater amplitude
- Energy ratio: 10^(3(7.0-5.0)/2) = 10^3 = 1,000 times more energy released"

### 9. Moore's Law and Technological Growth

**Simple explanation:** "Moore's Law is an observation that computing power doubles approximately every two years, following an exponential growth pattern."

**Moore's Law model:**
- N(t) = N₀·2^(t/2)
- N₀: Initial number of transistors
- t: Time in years
- Doubling time: 2 years

**Historical perspective:**
- Original 1965 prediction by Gordon Moore: Doubling of components per chip every year
- Revised to doubling every two years
- Has held remarkably accurate for 50+ years
- Example: 1971 Intel 4004 had 2,300 transistors; modern processors have billions

**Technological implications:**
- Exponential increase in computing power
- Exponential decrease in cost per calculation
- Enables previously impossible applications (AI, virtual reality, etc.)

**Example calculation:**
"If a processor in 2010 had 1 billion transistors, how many would we expect in 2022?
- Number of doubling periods: (2022-2010)/2 = 6
- N(12) = 1·2^6 = 64 billion transistors"

### 10. Combined Growth and Decay Models

**Simple explanation:** "Some real-world situations involve both growth and decay components happening simultaneously."

**Combined model forms:**
1. **Growth with limiting factor:**
   - P(t) = K - (K-P₀)·e^(-rt)
   - K: Limiting value (asymptote)
   - P₀: Initial value
   - r: Rate constant

2. **Sum of growth and decay terms:**
   - f(t) = a·e^(bt) + c·e^(-dt)
   - Used in models with competing processes

3. **Dampened oscillations:**
   - f(t) = e^(-at)·sin(bt) or e^(-at)·cos(bt)
   - Models systems that oscillate with decreasing amplitude

**Example application:**
"The concentration of a drug in the bloodstream that is simultaneously being absorbed and eliminated:
- C(t) = (ka·D·F/(V·(ka-k)))·(e^(-k·t) - e^(-ka·t))
- ka: Absorption rate constant
- k: Elimination rate constant
- D: Dose
- F: Bioavailability
- V: Volume of distribution"

**Visual insight:** "These combined models can create curves with peaks and valleys that more accurately represent complex real-world phenomena."

## Common Misconceptions and How to Address Them

1. **"All growth in nature is exponential"**
   - Clarification: "Natural growth often starts exponential but faces limiting factors that lead to logistic (S-curve) growth instead."

2. **"Exponential decay means something disappears completely"**
   - Clarification: "With exponential decay, the quantity approaches zero but mathematically never reaches it. In practice, we consider it effectively gone when it's below some threshold."

3. **"Each additional unit on a logarithmic scale represents the same increase"**
   - Clarification: "Logarithmic scales represent multiplication, not addition. Each additional unit means multiplying by the base (often 10), not adding the same amount."

4. **"Models can perfectly predict real-world growth/decay"**
   - Clarification: "Models are simplified representations that help us understand and make predictions, but they can't account for all variables or unexpected events."

5. **"Moore's Law will continue indefinitely"**
   - Clarification: "Physical limitations mean exponential growth in computing can't continue forever. Eventually, fundamental limits of physics will slow progress unless new computing paradigms are developed."

## Check for Understanding

After covering the material, ask these questions:
1. "What's the difference between the unconstrained exponential population model and the logistic model?"
2. "Why are logarithmic scales used for phenomena like earthquake magnitude?"
3. "How does carbon-14 dating utilize exponential decay?"
4. "What happens to the growth rate of a technology as it approaches market saturation?"
5. "How do pharmacologists use half-life to determine medication dosing schedules?"

## Practice Problems

1. A bacterial culture starts with 500 bacteria and grows at 40% per hour. How many bacteria will there be after 5 hours?

2. The half-life of a radioactive isotope is 20 days. If you start with 80 mg, how much will remain after 65 days?

3. The loudness of sound increases exponentially with the decibel level. If one sound is 30 dB louder than another, how many times more intense is it?

4. A new social media platform is growing according to the function U(t) = 1000·2^(t/3), where t is time in months. How many users will it have after 18 months?

5. Carbon-14 has a half-life of 5,730 years. An ancient tool contains 42% of the original carbon-14. Approximately how old is the tool?

6. A lake is contaminated with 150 ppm of a chemical that decays at 8% per month. How long will it take for the concentration to reach the safe level of 5 ppm?

7. A population grows according to the logistic model P(t) = 10000/(1 + 19·e^(-0.2t)), where t is in years. What is the carrying capacity of this environment?

8. If computing power doubles every 18 months according to Moore's Law, how much more powerful will computers be in 9 years compared to today?

**Solutions:**

1. Using P(t) = P₀·(1+r)^t:
   P(5) = 500·(1+0.4)^5 = 500·(1.4)^5 = 500·5.38 = 2,690 bacteria

2. First determine how many half-lives have passed:
   65 days ÷ 20 days = 3.25 half-lives
   Remaining amount = 80·(1/2)^3.25 = 80·(1/2)^3·(1/2)^0.25
   = 80·0.125·0.84 ≈ 8.4 mg

3. Using dB = 10·log₁₀(I/I₀):
   30 = 10·log₁₀(I/I₀)
   3 = log₁₀(I/I₀)
   I/I₀ = 10^3 = 1,000
   The sound is 1,000 times more intense

4. Using U(t) = 1000·2^(t/3):
   U(18) = 1000·2^(18/3) = 1000·2^6 = 1000·64 = 64,000 users

5. Using t = -(5730/ln(2))·ln(P/P₀):
   t = -(5730/ln(2))·ln(0.42)
   t = -8267·(-0.868)
   t ≈ 7,176 years old

6. Using 5 = 150·e^(-0.08t):
   0.0333 = e^(-0.08t)
   ln(0.0333) = -0.08t
   -3.4 = -0.08t
   t = 42.5 months

7. In the logistic model P(t) = K/(1 + a·e^(-bt)), K represents the carrying capacity.
   Therefore, the carrying capacity is 10,000.

8. Using P(t) = P₀·2^(t/d) where d is the doubling time:
   P(9) = P₀·2^(9/1.5) = P₀·2^6 = P₀·64
   Computers will be 64 times more powerful
