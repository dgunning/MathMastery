# Unit 2: Exponential Functions

## Unit Overview
This unit introduces exponential functions, which model growth and decay patterns found throughout nature, technology, and finance. Unlike the linear and quadratic functions covered previously, exponential functions have a constant multiplication factor rather than a constant addition factor, leading to dramatically different behavior.

Exponential functions are essential for understanding compound interest, population growth, radioactive decay, and even the spread of information online. By mastering these concepts, your teenager will gain powerful mathematical tools that have direct applications in financial planning, science, and data analysis.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this unit, your teenager will be able to:
- Evaluate expressions with rational exponents
- Identify and graph exponential functions
- Solve exponential equations
- Apply exponential models to real-world situations
- Make connections between numeric, algebraic, and graphical representations
- Use technology to explore and analyze exponential relationships

## Lesson Structure

### Lesson 1: Introduction to Exponential Functions

#### What You're Teaching
Exponential functions model situations where a quantity grows or decays by the same percentage over equal time intervals. Unlike linear functions that add the same amount repeatedly, exponential functions multiply by the same factor repeatedly, creating patterns that start slowly and then accelerate dramatically (or decrease rapidly toward zero).

This lesson builds on your teenager's prior knowledge of exponents from earlier grades but extends to more sophisticated applications and properties.

#### Core Content

- **Concept 1: Exponential Growth vs. Linear Growth**
  - **Simple explanation:** "Linear growth adds the same amount each time, while exponential growth multiplies by the same factor each time."
  
  - **Visual representation:** Draw or show a table comparing linear vs. exponential:
    ```
    Linear: y = 3x + 1      Exponential: y = 2ˣ
    x = 0 → y = 1          x = 0 → y = 1
    x = 1 → y = 4          x = 1 → y = 2
    x = 2 → y = 7          x = 2 → y = 4
    x = 3 → y = 10         x = 3 → y = 8
    x = 4 → y = 13         x = 4 → y = 16
    x = 5 → y = 16         x = 5 → y = 32
    ```
  
  - **Real-world example:** "If you save $100 per month, that's linear growth. If your investment grows by 7% each year, that's exponential growth. After many years, the exponential growth will far exceed the linear growth."
  
  - **Common misconception:** "Many people underestimate exponential growth because our brains are wired to think linearly. This is why compound interest seems to 'magically' grow money, and why epidemics can spread faster than expected."

- **Concept 2: Properties of Exponential Functions (f(x) = bˣ)**
  - **Simple explanation:** "An exponential function has the form f(x) = bˣ, where b is called the base. If b > 1, the function grows exponentially. If 0 < b < 1, the function decays exponentially."
  
  - **Key properties:**
    - Domain: All real numbers
    - Range: All positive real numbers (y > 0)
    - y-intercept: Always (0, 1) because b⁰ = 1 for any base b
    - Horizontal asymptote: The x-axis (y = 0) as x → -∞ (for growth)
    - Always passes through the point (0, 1)
  
  - **Visual aid:** Draw the general shape of exponential growth (b > 1) and decay (0 < b < 1) on the same graph.
  
  - **Technology connection:** "Video games often use exponential functions for leveling up—each level requires more experience points than the previous one."

- **Concept 3: Evaluating Exponential Expressions**
  - **Simple explanation:** "Calculating values of exponential functions means applying the exponent rules you already know."
  
  - **Key exponent rules review:**
    - b^(m+n) = b^m × b^n
    - b^(m-n) = b^m ÷ b^n
    - (b^m)^n = b^(m×n)
    - b⁰ = 1
    - b^(-n) = 1/b^n
  
  - **Example calculations:**
    - 2³ = 8
    - 2^(-2) = 1/2² = 1/4 = 0.25
    - 3¹·⁵ = 3^(3/2) = √(3³) = √27 ≈ 5.2
  
  - **Real-world application:** "Calculating compound interest: $1000 invested for 3 years at 5% compounded annually would be $1000 × (1.05)³ = $1000 × 1.1576 = $1,157.60"

#### Guided Activities

- **Activity 1: "Doubling Time Challenge"**
  - **Materials needed:**
    - Calculator
    - Graph paper or Desmos.com account
    - Paper and pencil
  
  - **Instructions:**
    1. Ask: "If you had the choice between $1000 now or starting with 1¢ that doubles every day for 30 days, which would you choose?"
    2. Work out the value of the penny after each doubling:
       - Day 1: 1¢
       - Day 2: 2¢
       - Day 3: 4¢
       - ...and so on
    3. Plot the results on a graph (by hand or using Desmos)
    4. Find the day when the penny option exceeds $1000
  
  - **Discussion questions:**
    - "How many days did it take for the penny option to exceed $1000?"
    - "What's the final amount after 30 days?" (Answer: Over $5 million!)
    - "Why is exponential growth often underestimated?"
    - "How could you represent this growth with an exponential function?"
  
  - **Extension:** Compare the growth to a linear function where you add $1000/30 = $33.33 each day.

- **Activity 2: "Half-Life Simulation"**
  - **Materials needed:**
    - 20-30 coins or small objects
    - Paper for recording results
    - Calculator
  
  - **Instructions:**
    1. Start with all coins showing heads up
    2. Each "round," flip all the coins
    3. Remove all coins that show tails
    4. Count and record how many coins remain
    5. Continue until no coins are left
  
  - **Expected outcome:**
    - Approximately half the coins will remain after each round
    - The data will follow an exponential decay pattern: N = N₀ × (1/2)ᵗ
  
  - **Discussion questions:**
    - "How is this similar to radioactive decay?"
    - "Why isn't it exactly half each time?"
    - "How could you represent this mathematically?"
    - "How could you determine the 'half-life' from your data?"
  
  - **Real-world connection:** "This is exactly how scientists date ancient artifacts using carbon-14, which has a half-life of about 5,730 years."

#### Real-World Applications

- **Compound Interest**
  - Explain that the formula A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) models compound interest
  - Show how different compounding periods affect growth
  - Calculate practical examples like student loans or retirement savings
  - Connection: "This is why starting to save for retirement early makes such a huge difference."

- **Population Growth**
  - Discuss how exponential functions model population growth: P = P₀e^(rt)
  - Look up real population data for your city/country
  - Calculate doubling times for different growth rates
  - Connection: "This helps urban planners decide when new infrastructure is needed."

- **Technology Adoption**
  - Explain how new technologies often spread exponentially
  - Examples: smartphones, social media platforms, viral content
  - Discuss how companies use this understanding for marketing
  - Connection: "This is why some apps or videos suddenly seem to be 'everywhere'."

#### Check for Understanding

- **Key Questions:**
  1. "What's the difference between linear and exponential growth?"
  2. "What happens to an exponential function f(x) = bˣ when b > 1? When 0 < b < 1?"
  3. "Why does any exponential function of the form f(x) = bˣ always pass through the point (0,1)?"
  4. "How can you tell from an equation whether a function represents growth or decay?"

- **Practice Problems:**
  1. Evaluate 4^(-1.5)
  2. Graph f(x) = 3ˣ and g(x) = (1/3)ˣ on the same coordinate plane
  3. If $500 is invested at 6% compounded annually, find the value after 10 years
  4. A town has 5000 people and grows by 2% annually. Write an exponential function and find the population in 15 years

- **Solutions:**
  1. 4^(-1.5) = 1/4^1.5 = 1/(4 × 2) = 1/8 = 0.125
  2. [Graph would show f(x) growing upward and g(x) decaying toward x-axis]
  3. A = 500(1 + 0.06)¹⁰ = 500(1.06)¹⁰ = 500 × 1.7908 = $895.42
  4. P(t) = 5000(1.02)ᵗ; P(15) = 5000(1.02)¹⁵ = 5000 × 1.3459 = 6,729 people

## Tips for Teaching Success

- **Start with intuition:** Before formal definitions, build intuition through doubling/tripling patterns.

- **Use technology:** Graphing calculators or apps help visualize exponential behavior that's difficult to plot by hand.

- **Connect to interests:** If your teen is interested in finance, focus on investments; if science, focus on population growth or radioactive decay.

- **Address the "wow factor":** Exponential growth produces surprising results—use this to create memorable moments of realization.

- **Be patient with notation:** Rational exponents and exponential equations can be confusing at first. Allow time for the notation to become familiar.
