## Answer Key

### Multiple Choice
1. c) (x - 3)(x + 2)(x - 2)
   * x³ - 3x² - 4x + 12 = (x - 3)(x² - 4) = (x - 3)(x + 2)(x - 2)

2. a) y ≤ 8
   * For a parabola in the form f(x) = a(x - h)² + k with a < 0, the range is y ≤ k

3. a) 1
   * g(2) = 2(2) - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1
   * f(g(2)) = f(1) = 1² - 5(1) + 6 = 1 - 5 + 6 = 2

4. c) -56
   * Discriminant = b² - 4ac = (-4)² - 4(2)(7) = 16 - 56 = -56

5. b) 3√2
   * √50 - √18 + √8 = 5√2 - 3√2 + 2√2 = 4√2

6. c) (3, 8) and (-2, -2)
   * Substituting y = 2x + 2 into y = x² - 4:
   * 2x + 2 = x² - 4
   * 0 = x² - 2x - 6
   * 0 = (x - 3)(x + 2)
   * x = 3 or x = -2
   * When x = 3: y = 2(3) + 2 = 8
   * When x = -2: y = 2(-2) + 2 = -2

### Short Answer
7. 2x²(x² - 1) = 2x²(x - 1)(x + 1)
   * Factor out the GCF 2x², then use the difference of squares formula

8. Domain: -4 ≤ x ≤ 4; Range: 0 ≤ y ≤ 4
   * The expression under the square root must be non-negative, so 16 - x² ≥ 0, which gives x² ≤ 16, so -4 ≤ x ≤ 4
   * The maximum value of the function occurs at x = 0, giving f(0) = 4, and the minimum is 0

9. f(x) = 2x² + 12x + 13
   = 2(x² + 6x) + 13
   = 2(x² + 6x + 9 - 9) + 13
   = 2(x + 3)² - 18 + 13
   = 2(x + 3)² - 5
   * Vertex form: f(x) = 2(x + 3)² - 5

10. 3√12/(2√3) = 3√(4 · 3)/(2√3) = 3 · 2√3/(2√3) = 3

11. Using the quadratic formula:
    x = (5 ± √(25 + 24))/6 = (5 ± √49)/6 = (5 ± 7)/6
    x = (5 + 7)/6 = 2 or x = (5 - 7)/6 = -1/3

12. If the roots are x = -1/2 and x = 4, then:
    x + 1/2 = 0 or x - 4 = 0
    The quadratic equation is (x + 1/2)(x - 4) = 0
    x² - 4x + 1/2x - 2 = 0
    x² - 7/2x - 2 = 0
    Multiplying by 2: 2x² - 7x - 4 = 0

### Extended Response
13. a) Vertex:
       * x = -b/(2a) = -8/(-4) = 2
       * f(2) = -2(2)² + 8(2) - 3 = -8 + 16 - 3 = 5
       * Vertex: (2, 5)
    
    b) Axis of symmetry: x = 2
    
    c) Y-intercept: f(0) = -3
    
    d) X-intercepts:
       * -2x² + 8x - 3 = 0
       * Using the quadratic formula:
       * x = (-8 ± √(64 - 4(-2)(-3)))/(2(-2)) = (-8 ± √(64 - 24))/(-4) = (-8 ± √40)/(-4)
       * x = (-8 + 2√10)/(-4) or x = (-8 - 2√10)/(-4)
       * x ≈ 0.42 or x ≈ 3.58
    
    e) [Graph should show a parabola opening downward with vertex at (2, 5), y-intercept at (0, -3), and x-intercepts at approximately (0.42, 0) and (3.58, 0)]

14. a) If the perimeter is 30 meters, and w is the width, then the length l = 15 - w
       * Area function: A(w) = w · l = w(15 - w) = 15w - w²
    
    b) Domain: 0 < w < 15
       * Width must be positive and less than half the perimeter
    
    c) To find the maximum:
       * A'(w) = 15 - 2w = 0
       * w = 7.5 meters
       * The length is also l = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 meters
    
    d) Maximum area:
       * A(7.5) = 15(7.5) - (7.5)² = 112.5 - 56.25 = 56.25 square meters

15. a) Algebraic solution:
       * Substitute y = -x + 5 into y = x² - 2x - 3:
       * -x + 5 = x² - 2x - 3
       * 0 = x² - x - 8
       * 0 = (x - 4)(x + 2)
       * x = 4 or x = -2
       * When x = 4: y = -4 + 5 = 1
       * When x = -2: y = -(-2) + 5 = 7
       * Solutions: (4, 1) and (-2, 7)
    
    b) Graphical interpretation:
       * The solutions represent the points of intersection between the parabola y = x² - 2x - 3 and the line y = -x + 5
    
    c) Verification:
       * For (4, 1):
         * y = x² - 2x - 3 = 4² - 2(4) - 3 = 16 - 8 - 3 = 5
         * y = -x + 5 = -4 + 5 = 1
         * There's an error in our calculation. Let's recalculate:
         * y = x² - 2x - 3 = 16 - 8 - 3 = 5
         * This doesn't match y = 1, so (4, 1) is not a solution.
         * Correct calculation:
         * x² - 2x - 3 = -x + 5
         * x² - x - 8 = 0
         * (x - 4)(x + 2) = 0
         * x = 4 or x = -2
         * When x = 4: y = -4 + 5 = 1
         * When x = -2: y = 2 + 5 = 7
         * For (4, 1):
           * y = x² - 2x - 3 = 16 - 8 - 3 = 5
           * y = -x + 5 = -4 + 5 = 1
           * This is still inconsistent. Let's double-check our work:
           * x² - 2x - 3 = -x + 5
           * x² - x - 8 = 0
           * Using the quadratic formula:
           * x = (1 ± √(1 + 32))/2 = (1 ± √33)/2
           * x ≈ 3.37 or x ≈ -2.37
           * When x ≈ 3.37: y ≈ -3.37 + 5 ≈ 1.63
           * When x ≈ -2.37: y ≈ 2.37 + 5 ≈ 7.37
           * Solutions: (3.37, 1.63) and (-2.37, 7.37)
