   b) f(x) = 3x² + 6x + 4
   c) f(x) = -2x² + 4x - 7
   d) f(x) = 1/2x² - 3x + 1

3. Find the vertex of each quadratic function and determine whether it represents a minimum or maximum value:
   a) f(x) = x² + 10x + 21

   b) f(x) = x² - 6x + 7
   c) f(x) = 2x² + 12x + 19

5. Convert each quadratic function to vertex form and identify the vertex:
   a) f(x) = x² - 10x + 23
   b) f(x) = 4x² + 16x + 13
   c) f(x) = -2x² + 8x - 3
   d) f(x) = 1/3x² - 2x + 5

6. Convert each quadratic function to vertex form and determine whether the parabola opens upward or downward:
   a) f(x) = x² + 4x - 12
   b) f(x) = -x² - 6x - 10
   c) f(x) = 3x² - 9x + 8
   d) f(x) = -4x² + 24x - 39

## Part C: Graphing Parabolas

7. For each quadratic function:
   i. Find the vertex
   ii. Find the axis of symmetry
   iii. Find the y-intercept
   iv. Find the x-intercepts (if they exist)
   v. Sketch the graph
   
   a) f(x) = x² - 4x + 3
   b) f(x) = -x² + 2x + 3
   c) f(x) = 2x² + 4x - 6
   d) f(x) = -3x² - 6x - 1

8. Match each quadratic function with its graph (A, B, C, or D):
   a) f(x) = (x - 2)² - 3
   b) f(x) = -(x + 1)² + 4
   c) f(x) = 2(x + 3)² - 1
   d) f(x) = -1/2(x - 4)² + 2
   
   [Note: In the actual worksheet, include 4 parabola graphs labeled A, B, C, and D]

## Part D: Applications

9. A ball is thrown upward from a height of 6 feet with an initial velocity of 32 feet per second. The height h(t) of the ball (in feet) after t seconds is given by h(t) = -16t² + 32t + 6.
   a) Find the vertex of this parabola.
   b) What is the maximum height reached by the ball?

    a) Find the vertex of this parabola.
    b) How many items should be produced to maximize profit?
    c) What is the maximum profit?
    d) What is the profit if 80 items are produced and sold?

11. A rectangular garden is to be created along the side of a house. If 60 feet of fencing is available for the three remaining sides, find the dimensions that will maximize the area of the garden.
    a) Express the area A as a function of the width x.
