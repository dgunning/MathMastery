   𝗮. f(x) = x² - 4x + 3
   
   𝗯. f(x) = -x² + 2x + 3
   
   𝗰. f(x) = 2x² + 4x - 6
   
   𝗱. f(x) = -3x² - 6x - 1

8. Match each quadratic function with its graph (A, B, C, or D):
   
   𝗮. f(x) = (x - 2)² - 3
   
   𝗯. f(x) = -(x + 1)² + 4
   
   𝗰. f(x) = 2(x + 3)² - 1
   
   𝗱. f(x) = -1/2(x - 4)² + 2
   
   [Note: In the actual worksheet, include 4 parabola graphs labeled A, B, C, and D]
