# Lesson 6: Maximum and Minimum Values - Practice Worksheet

## Part A: Identifying Maximum and Minimum Values

1. For each quadratic function, determine whether it has a maximum or minimum value, and find that value:
   
   𝗮. f(x) = x² + 4x + 7
   
   𝗯. f(x) = -2x² + 8x - 3
   
   𝗰. f(x) = 3x² - 6x + 5
   
   𝗱. f(x) = -x² + 2x + 8

2. Find the maximum or minimum value of each function and the value of x where it occurs:
   
   𝗮. f(x) = x² - 10x + 24
   
   𝗯. f(x) = -3x² + 12x - 5
   
   𝗰. f(x) = 2x² + 4x - 7
   
   𝗱. f(x) = -1/2x² + 3x + 1

3. For each function in vertex form, identify the maximum or minimum value:
   
   𝗮. f(x) = 2(x - 3)² + 4
   
   𝗯. f(x) = -5(x + 1)² - 6
   
   𝗰. f(x) = 3(x - 2)² - 8
   
   𝗱. f(x) = -4(x + 3)² + 12

## Part B: Analyzing Graphs

4. For each graph of a quadratic function, determine:
   i. Whether the function has a maximum or minimum value
   ii. The coordinates of the vertex
   iii. The equation of the axis of symmetry
   
   [Note: In the actual worksheet, include 4 parabola graphs]

5. Match each quadratic function with its graph (A, B, C, or D):
   
   𝗮. f(x) = (x - 1)² + 2 (minimum value of 2 at x = 1)
   
   𝗯. f(x) = -(x + 2)² + 3 (maximum value of 3 at x = -2)
   
   𝗰. f(x) = 2(x - 3)² - 1 (minimum value of -1 at x = 3)
   
   𝗱. f(x) = -3(x + 1)² + 4 (maximum value of 4 at x = -1)
   
   [Note: In the actual worksheet, include 4 parabola graphs labeled A, B, C, and D]

## Part C: Applications of Maximum and Minimum Values

6. A farmer has 200 meters of fencing to enclose a rectangular field. Express the area A of the field as a function of its width x.
   
   𝗮. Write the area function A(x).
   
   𝗯. What are the domain restrictions on x?
   
   𝗰. Find the dimensions that maximize the area.
   
   𝗱. What is the maximum area?

7. A company finds that the profit P(x) (in dollars) from selling x units of a product is given by P(x) = -0.2x² + 80x - 1000.
   
   𝗮. How many units should be sold to maximize profit?
   
   𝗯. What is the maximum profit?
   
   𝗰. What is the profit if 150 units are sold?
   
   𝗱. What is the break-even point (where profit equals zero)?

8. A ball is thrown upward from ground level with an initial velocity of 64 feet per second. The height h(t) of the ball (in feet) after t seconds is given by h(t) = -16t² + 64t.
   
   𝗮. When does the ball reach its maximum height?
   
   𝗯. What is the maximum height?
   
   𝗰. When does the ball return to the ground?
   
   𝗱. During which time interval is the ball higher than 60 feet?

## Part D: Finding Maximum and Minimum Values with Constraints

9. Find the minimum value of f(x, y) = x² + y² subject to the constraint x + y = 10.
   
   𝗮. Express y in terms of x using the constraint.
   
   𝗯. Substitute this expression into f(x, y) to get a function of x only.
   
   𝗰. Find the critical point of this function.
   
   𝗱. Determine the minimum value of f(x, y) and where it occurs.

10. Find the maximum product of two numbers whose sum is 20.
    
    𝗮. Express the product P as a function of one variable.
    
    𝗯. Find the critical point of this function.
    
    𝗰. Determine the maximum product and the two numbers.
    
    𝗱. Verify your answer by testing nearby values.

11. Find the minimum sum of two positive numbers whose product is 100.
    
    𝗮. Express the sum S as a function of one variable.
    
    𝗯. Find the critical point of this function.
    
    𝗰. Determine the minimum sum and the two numbers.
    
    𝗱. Verify your answer by testing nearby values.

## Part E: Challenge Problems

12. A rectangular box with a square base is to have a volume of 1000 cubic inches. The material for the base costs 0.10 per square inch, the material for the top costs 0.10 per square inch, and the material for the sides costs 0.05 per square inch. Find the dimensions of the box that minimize the cost of materials.

13. A Norman window has the shape of a rectangle surmounted by a semicircle. If the perimeter of the window is 30 feet, find the dimensions of the window that will admit the maximum amount of light (i.e., maximize the area).

14. The sum of two numbers is 50. Find the values of the numbers that maximize the sum of their logarithms (base 10). [Hint: Maximizing the sum of logarithms is equivalent to maximizing the product of the numbers.]
