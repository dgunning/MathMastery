- **Video Game Design:** Game developers at companies like Epic Games and Electronic Arts use quadratics to create realistic physics engines. When you see characters jump, projectiles fly, or vehicles accelerate in games like Fortnite or Madden NFL, you're watching quadratic equations in action.

- **Architecture & Construction:** Architects use quadratic equations to design arches, suspension bridges, and cable-supported structures. The iconic curve of the St. Louis Gateway Arch follows a quadratic function, with engineers solving these equations to ensure structural integrity.

- **Economics & Business:** Companies like Amazon and Walmart use quadratic models to determine optimal pricing strategies, inventory levels, and profit maximization. Their analysts solve these equations to find the perfect balance point between cost and revenue.

**Career Connection:** Mastering quadratic equations opens doors to careers in engineering ($95,000+), data science ($120,000+), financial analysis ($85,000+), and software development ($110,000+). These high-paying fields all rely on your ability to find solutions to problems modeled by quadratics. NASA even maintains a department of mathematicians who specialize in solving complex quadratic systems for space missions.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Understanding Quadratic Equations

**Simple explanation:** "A quadratic equation has the form ax² + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are constants and a ≠ 0. The solutions to this equation are the values of x that make the equation true - also called the roots or zeros."

**Key insight:** "The solutions to a quadratic equation correspond to the x-coordinates of the points where the parabola y = ax² + bx + c crosses the x-axis."

**Visual representation:**
```
    y = ax² + bx + c
         |                      
         |                      
         |       /|\           
         |      / | \          
         |     /  |  \         
    -----+----+---+---+------
         |   /    |    \      
         |  /     |     \     
         | /      |      \    
         |/       |       \   
    x₁---+--------+--------+---x₂
        root1             root2
```

**Types of solutions:**
- Two distinct real solutions: The parabola crosses the x-axis at two points
- One repeated real solution: The parabola touches the x-axis at one point (the vertex)
- No real solutions: The parabola doesn't intersect the x-axis

### 2. Solving by Factoring

**Simple explanation:** "If we can factor the quadratic expression into two binomials, we can easily find the solutions using the Zero Product Property: if a × b = 0, then either a = 0 or b = 0."

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Make sure the equation is in standard form: ax² + bx + c = 0
2. Factor the left side of the equation
3. Set each factor equal to zero
4. Solve the resulting equations

**Example 1: When a = 1**

Solve the quadratic equation: x² + 5x + 6 = 0

> **Solution Walkthrough**
> 
> #### Step 1: Factor the left side
> - We need to find two numbers that multiply to give 6 and add up to give 5
> - The numbers 2 and 3 work because 2 × 3 = 6 and 2 + 3 = 5
> - Therefore: x² + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)
> 
> #### Step 2: Set each factor equal to zero
> - Using the Zero Product Property: if (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0, then either x + 2 = 0 or x + 3 = 0
> - This gives us two equations to solve
> 
> #### Step 3: Solve each equation
> - From x + 2 = 0, we get x = -2
> - From x + 3 = 0, we get x = -3
> 
> #### Step 4: Check in the original equation
> - For x = -2: (-2)² + 5(-2) + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0 ✓
> - For x = -3: (-3)² + 5(-3) + 6 = 9 - 15 + 6 = 0 ✓
> 
> #### Final Result
> - The solutions to the equation x² + 5x + 6 = 0 are x = -2 and x = -3

**Example 2: When a ≠ 1**

Solve the quadratic equation: 2x² - 5x - 3 = 0

> **Solution Walkthrough**
> 
> #### Step 1: Factor the left side
> - When a ≠ 1, we need to find two numbers that multiply to give a·c = 2·(-3) = -6 and add up to give b = -5
> - The numbers 1 and -6 work because 1 × (-6) = -6 and 1 + (-6) = -5
> - We can now factor the expression: 2x² - 5x - 3 = (2x + 1)(x - 3)
> 
> #### Step 2: Set each factor equal to zero
> - Using the Zero Product Property: if (2x + 1)(x - 3) = 0, then either 2x + 1 = 0 or x - 3 = 0
> - This gives us two equations to solve
> 
> #### Step 3: Solve each equation
> - From 2x + 1 = 0, we get 2x = -1, so x = -1/2
> - From x - 3 = 0, we get x = 3
> 
> #### Step 4: Check in the original equation
> - For x = -1/2: 2(-1/2)² - 5(-1/2) - 3 = 2(1/4) + 5/2 - 3 = 1/2 + 5/2 - 3 = 3 - 3 = 0 ✓
> - For x = 3: 2(3)² - 5(3) - 3 = 2(9) - 15 - 3 = 18 - 15 - 3 = 0 ✓
> 
> #### Final Result
> - The solutions to the equation 2x² - 5x - 3 = 0 are x = -1/2 and x = 3

**Factoring strategies review:**
- For ax² + bx + c (a = 1): Find two numbers that multiply to give c and add to give b
- For ax² + bx + c (a ≠ 1): Find two numbers that multiply to give ac and add to give b, then use those to rewrite the middle term and group

**Key insight:** "Not all quadratic expressions can be factored using integers or rational numbers. When factoring doesn't work, we need other methods."

### 3. The Quadratic Formula

**Simple explanation:** "The quadratic formula gives us the solutions to any quadratic equation. For the equation ax² + bx + c = 0, the solutions are:

x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)

This formula comes from completing the square on the general form of a quadratic equation."

**When to use it:** "The quadratic formula works for every quadratic equation, but it's especially useful when:
- The quadratic expression doesn't factor nicely
- You want to find decimal approximations of solutions
- You need to determine the exact form of irrational solutions"

**Example 1: Two distinct real solutions**

Solve the quadratic equation: x² - 5x + 3 = 0

> **Solution Walkthrough**
> 
> #### Step 1: Identify the coefficients
> - Compare with the standard form ax² + bx + c = 0
> - a = 1 (coefficient of x²)
> - b = -5 (coefficient of x)
> - c = 3 (constant term)
> 
> #### Step 2: Apply the quadratic formula
> - The formula is x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a
> - Substitute the values: x = [5 ± √((-5)² - 4(1)(3))] / 2(1)
> - Simplify the discriminant: √(25 - 12) = √13
> - The formula becomes: x = [5 ± √13] / 2
> 
> #### Step 3: Calculate both solutions
> - For the positive case: x = (5 + √13) / 2 ≈ 4.30
> - For the negative case: x = (5 - √13) / 2 ≈ 0.70
> 
> #### Final Result
> - The equation x² - 5x + 3 = 0 has two distinct real solutions:
> - x ≈ 4.30 (exact form: (5 + √13) / 2)
> - x ≈ 0.70 (exact form: (5 - √13) / 2)

**Example 2: One repeated solution**

Solve the quadratic equation: 4x² - 12x + 9 = 0

> **Solution Walkthrough**
> 
> #### Step 1: Identify the coefficients
> - Compare with the standard form ax² + bx + c = 0
> - a = 4 (coefficient of x²)
> - b = -12 (coefficient of x)
> - c = 9 (constant term)
> 
> #### Step 2: Apply the quadratic formula
> - The formula is x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a
> - Substitute the values: x = [12 ± √((-12)² - 4(4)(9))] / 2(4)
> - Calculate the discriminant: 144 - 144 = 0
> - The formula becomes: x = [12 ± 0] / 8 = 12/8 = 3/2
> 
> #### Step 3: Analyze the result
> - When the discriminant equals zero, there is exactly one solution (a repeated root)
> - This means the parabola touches the x-axis at exactly one point (the vertex)
> - The only solution is x = 3/2
> 
> #### Final Result
> - The equation 4x² - 12x + 9 = 0 has exactly one solution: x = 3/2
> - This is also called a repeated root or a double root

**Example 3: No real solutions**

Solve the quadratic equation: 2x² + x + 1 = 0

> **Solution Walkthrough**
> 
> #### Step 1: Identify the coefficients
> - Compare with the standard form ax² + bx + c = 0
> - a = 2 (coefficient of x²)
> - b = 1 (coefficient of x)
> - c = 1 (constant term)
> 
> #### Step 2: Apply the quadratic formula
> - The formula is x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a
> - Substitute the values: x = [-1 ± √((1)² - 4(2)(1))] / 2(2)
> - Calculate the discriminant: 1 - 8 = -7
> - The formula becomes: x = [-1 ± √(-7)] / 4
> 
> #### Step 3: Analyze the result
> - When the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions
> - This means the parabola never crosses or touches the x-axis
> - The square root of a negative number is not a real number
> - (Note: There are two complex solutions, but they're beyond the scope of this lesson)
> 
> #### Final Result
> - The equation 2x² + x + 1 = 0 has no real solutions
> - This makes sense visually: the graph of y = 2x² + x + 1 stays above the x-axis

**Tip for calculations:** "Always simplify the discriminant (b² - 4ac) first to determine the nature of the solutions. This can save you work and help avoid errors."

### 4. Choosing the Best Method

**Simple explanation:** "There are several methods for solving quadratic equations, and the best one depends on the specific equation."

**Decision tree:**
1. Is the equation already in factored form like (x + a)(x + b) = 0? 
   - Yes → Use the Zero Product Property
   - No → Continue

2. Does one side of the equation equal zero? 
   - No → Rearrange to standard form
   - Yes → Continue

3. Can the quadratic expression be factored easily?
   - Yes → Use factoring
   - No → Continue

4. Is the coefficient of x² equal to 1, and are the other coefficients "nice" numbers?
   - Yes → Consider completing the square
   - No → Use the quadratic formula

**Examples of choosing methods:**
```
For x² - 4 = 0:
- This can be rewritten as x² = 4
- Then x = ±2
- Fastest method: Square root property
```

```
For x² - 6x + 9 = 0:
- This factors as (x - 3)² = 0
- Therefore x = 3
- Fastest method: Factoring
```

```
For 2x² - 7x + 3 = 0:
- This doesn't factor nicely with integers
- Fastest method: Quadratic formula
```

**Key insight:** "The quadratic formula always works, but other methods might be faster in specific cases."

### 5. Word Problems Involving Quadratic Equations

**Simple explanation:** "Many real-world problems lead to quadratic equations. The challenge is translating the problem into an equation."

**General approach:**
1. Identify the unknown quantity and assign a variable
2. Express the conditions of the problem in terms of the variable
3. Form a quadratic equation
4. Solve the equation
5. Answer the original question, making sure the answer makes sense in context

**Example 1: Area problem**

The length of a rectangle is 3 meters more than its width. If the area is 70 square meters, find the dimensions.

> **Solution Walkthrough**
> 
> #### Step 1: Define variables and relationships
> - Let w = width of the rectangle (in meters)
> - Then w + 3 = length (in meters)
> - This establishes the relationship between length and width
> 
> #### Step 2: Set up an equation using the area formula
> - We know that Area = length × width
> - Substitute what we know: 70 = (w + 3) × w
> - Distribute: 70 = w² + 3w
> 
> #### Step 3: Rearrange to standard form
> - Subtract 70 from both sides: w² + 3w - 70 = 0
> - Now we have a quadratic equation in standard form
> 
> #### Step 4: Solve using the quadratic formula
> - Identify a = 1, b = 3, c = -70
> - Apply the formula: w = [-3 ± √(9 + 280)] / 2
> - Simplify the discriminant: √289 = 17
> - Calculate both values: w = [-3 ± 17] / 2
> - This gives us w = 7 or w = -10
> 
> #### Step 5: Check and interpret the solution
> - Since width must be a positive value in this context, w = -10 is not valid
> - Therefore, w = 7 meters is our only valid solution
> - The length is w + 3 = 7 + 3 = 10 meters
> 
> #### Final Result
> - The rectangle's dimensions are 7 meters by 10 meters
> - We can verify: Area = 7 × 10 = 70 square meters, which matches our given condition

**Example 2: Projectile motion**

A ball is thrown upward from a height of 6 feet with an initial velocity of 32 feet per second. The height h(t) after t seconds is given by h(t) = -16t² + 32t + 6. When does the ball hit the ground?

> **Solution Walkthrough**
> 
> #### Step 1: Understand what we're looking for
> - The ball hits the ground when its height equals zero: h(t) = 0
> - We need to find the value of t that makes this true
> - Substitute into the height function: -16t² + 32t + 6 = 0
> 
> #### Step 2: Solve the quadratic equation
> - This quadratic doesn't factor easily, so we'll use the quadratic formula
> - Identify a = -16, b = 32, c = 6
> - Apply the formula: t = [-32 ± √(32² - 4(-16)(6))] / 2(-16)
> - Simplify: t = [-32 ± √(1024 + 384)] / -32
> - Calculate: t = [-32 ± √1408] / -32
> - Taking the square root: t = [-32 ± 37.5] / -32
> - This gives us t ≈ -0.17 or t ≈ 2.17
> 
> #### Step 3: Interpret the solution in context
> - In physics problems, we need to consider the practical meaning of solutions
> - Since we're starting at t = 0 when the ball is thrown, negative time values don't make physical sense
> - Therefore, t = -0.17 is not a valid solution in this context
> - The ball hits the ground at approximately t = 2.17 seconds
> 
> #### Final Result
> - The ball hits the ground approximately 2.17 seconds after being thrown
> - This represents the total time the ball is in the air

**Example 3: Number problem**

Find two consecutive integers whose product is 156.

> **Solution Walkthrough**
> 
> #### Step 1: Define variables
> - Let x = first integer
> - Then x + 1 = second integer (consecutive means it's exactly 1 more than the first)
> 
> #### Step 2: Express the condition mathematically
> - Their product equals 156: x(x + 1) = 156
> - Distribute: x² + x = 156
> 
> #### Step 3: Rearrange to standard form
> - Subtract 156 from both sides: x² + x - 156 = 0
> - Now we have a quadratic equation in standard form
> 
> #### Step 4: Factor the quadratic expression
> - We need to find factors of -156 that add up to 1
> - The factors 13 and -12 work: 13 × (-12) = -156 and 13 + (-12) = 1
> - Factor the expression: x² + x - 156 = (x + 13)(x - 12) = 0
> 
> #### Step 5: Solve the equation
> - Set each factor equal to zero: x + 13 = 0 or x - 12 = 0
> - Solve each equation: x = -13 or x = 12
> 
> #### Step 6: Find the consecutive integer pairs
> - For x = -13, the consecutive integers are -13 and -12
> - For x = 12, the consecutive integers are 12 and 13
> 
> #### Step 7: Verify both solutions
> - Check the first pair: (-13)(-12) = 156 ✓
> - Check the second pair: (12)(13) = 156 ✓
> 
> #### Final Result
> - There are two pairs of consecutive integers whose product is 156:
> - The pair -13 and -12
> - The pair 12 and 13

### 6. The Square Root Property

**Simple explanation:** "For equations in the form x² = k, we can solve directly using the square root property: if x² = k, then x = ±√k."

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Isolate the squared term
2. Take the square root of both sides
3. Remember to include both the positive and negative square roots

> - In our case: x = ±√25
> - Simplify: x = ±5
> 
> #### Step 3: Write out both solutions
> - The positive solution: x = 5
> - The negative solution: x = -5
> 
> #### Final Result
> - The solutions to x² - 25 = 0 are x = 5 and x = -5
> - We can verify: 5² - 25 = 25 - 25 = 0 ✓ and (-5)² - 25 = 25 - 25 = 0 ✓

**Example 2: With a coefficient**

Solve the quadratic equation: 3x² - 75 = 0

> **Solution Walkthrough**
> 
> #### Step 1: Rearrange to isolate the squared term
> - Start with the original equation: 3x² - 75 = 0
> - Add 75 to both sides: 3x² = 75
> - Divide both sides by 3: x² = 25
> 
> #### Step 2: Apply the square root property
> - If x² = k, then x = ±√k
> - In our case: x = ±√25
> - Simplify: x = ±5
> 
> #### Step 3: Verify your solutions
> - For x = 5: 3(5)² - 75 = 3(25) - 75 = 75 - 75 = 0 ✓
> - For x = -5: 3(-5)² - 75 = 3(25) - 75 = 75 - 75 = 0 ✓
> 
> #### Final Result
> - The solutions to 3x² - 75 = 0 are x = 5 and x = -5

### 7. Solving by Completing the Square

**Simple explanation:** "Completing the square allows us to rewrite a quadratic equation in a form where we can apply the square root property."

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Make sure the coefficient of x² is 1 (divide by the coefficient if necessary)
2. Move the constant term to the right side
3. Complete the square on the left side (add and subtract the appropriate term)
4. Rewrite the left side as a perfect square
5. Solve using the square root property

**Example: Completing the Square Method**

Solve the quadratic equation: x² - 6x + 5 = 0

> **Solution Walkthrough**
> 
> #### Step 1: Make sure the coefficient of x² is 1
> - In our equation x² - 6x + 5 = 0, the coefficient is already 1, so we can proceed
> 
> #### Step 2: Move the constant term to the right side
> - Start with: x² - 6x + 5 = 0
> - Subtract 5 from both sides: x² - 6x = -5
> 
> #### Step 3: Complete the square on the left side
> - To complete the square, take half the coefficient of x and square it: (-6 ÷ 2)² = (-3)² = 9
> - Add and subtract this value (9) to maintain the equation's balance:
> - Add 9 to both sides: x² - 6x + 9 = -5 + 9
> 
> #### Step 4: Rewrite as a perfect square trinomial
> - The left side can now be factored as a perfect square trinomial:
> - x² - 6x + 9 = (x - 3)²
> - This gives us: (x - 3)² = 4
> 
> #### Step 5: Apply the square root property
> - Take the square root of both sides: x - 3 = ±√4 = ±2
> - Solve for x: x = 3 ± 2
> - This gives us two solutions: x = 5 or x = 1
> 
> #### Step 6: Verify the solutions
> - For x = 5: 5² - 6(5) + 5 = 25 - 30 + 5 = 0 ✓
> - For x = 1: 1² - 6(1) + 5 = 1 - 6 + 5 = 0 ✓
> 
> #### Final Result
> - The solutions to x² - 6x + 5 = 0 are x = 5 and x = 1

Step 1: Revenue = price × quantity
        R = p(300 - 5p) = 300p - 5p²
        
Step 2: To maximize revenue, find where the derivative is zero
        R' = 300 - 10p = 0
        p = 30
        
Step 3: The maximum revenue occurs at a price of $30

A farmer wants to enclose a rectangular field with 200 meters of fencing. What dimensions will maximize the area?

Step 1: Let x = width, y = length
        Perimeter = 2x + 2y = 200
        y = 100 - x
        
Step 2: Area = x × y = x(100 - x) = 100x - x²
        
Step 3: To maximize area, find where the derivative is zero
        A' = 100 - 2x = 0
        x = 50
        
Step 4: The maximum area is achieved with dimensions 50m × 50m

## Practice Problems

1. Solve each equation by factoring:
   - x² + 7x + 12 = 0
   - 2x² - 5x - 3 = 0
   - x² - 9 = 0
   - 3x² - 12 = 0

2. Solve each equation using the quadratic formula:
   - x² - 3x - 10 = 0
   - 2x² + 5x - 3 = 0
   - 3x² - 2x + 1 = 0
   - 4x² - 12x + 9 = 0

5. The product of two consecutive even integers is 168. What are the integers?

**Solutions:**
1. Factoring:
   - x² + 7x + 12 = 0: (x + 3)(x + 4) = 0, so x = -3 or x = -4
   - 2x² - 5x - 3 = 0: (2x + 1)(x - 3) = 0, so x = -1/2 or x = 3
   - x² - 9 = 0: (x + 3)(x - 3) = 0, so x = -3 or x = 3
   - 3x² - 12 = 0: 3(x² - 4) = 0, so 3(x + 2)(x - 2) = 0, thus x = -2 or x = 2

2. Quadratic formula:
   - x² - 3x - 10 = 0: a = 1, b = -3, c = -10
     x = [3 ± √(9 + 40)]/2 = [3 ± √49]/2 = [3 ± 7]/2, so x = 5 or x = -2
   - 2x² + 5x - 3 = 0: a = 2, b = 5, c = -3
     x = [-5 ± √(25 + 24)]/4 = [-5 ± √49]/4 = [-5 ± 7]/4, so x = 1/2 or x = -3
   - 3x² - 2x + 1 = 0: a = 3, b = -2, c = 1
     x = [2 ± √(4 - 12)]/6 = [2 ± √(-8)]/6, no real solutions
   - 4x² - 12x + 9 = 0: a = 4, b = -12, c = 9
     x = [12 ± √(144 - 144)]/8 = [12 ± 0]/8 = 3/2, one solution

3. Rectangle problem:
   - Let w = width, then w + 5 = length
   - Area = w(w + 5) = 84
   - w² + 5w - 84 = 0
   - (w + 12)(w - 7) = 0
   - w = -12 or w = 7
   - Since width must be positive, w = 7 cm and length = 12 cm

4. Ball problem:
   - The ball hits the ground when h(t) = 0
   - -16t² + 64t = 0
   - -16t(t - 4) = 0
   - t = 0 or t = 4
   - t = 0 is the initial position, so the ball hits the ground again at t = 4 seconds

5. Consecutive even integers problem:
   - Let n = first even integer, then n + 2 = second even integer
   - n(n + 2) = 168
   - n² + 2n - 168 = 0
   - (n + 14)(n - 12) = 0
   - n = -14 or n = 12
   - For n = -14, the integers are -14 and -12
   - For n = 12, the integers are 12 and 14
   - Check: (-14)(-12) = 168 and (12)(14) = 168
