## Key Concepts

### 1. Review of Basic Factoring

**Simple explanation:** "Before we dive into advanced factoring, let's quickly review what you already know. Factoring is like unpacking a mathematical expression into its simplest parts - the factors that multiply together to create the original expression."

**Quick review examples:**
- Common factor: 12x + 8 = 4(3x + 2)
- Difference of squares: x² - 16 = (x + 4)(x - 4)
- Simple trinomials: x² + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)

**Connection to new material:** "Now we're going to build on these skills to handle more complex expressions that don't factor as easily."

### 2. Factoring Trinomials with Leading Coefficients

**Simple explanation:** "When the coefficient of x² isn't 1, we need additional strategies. For example, in 2x² + 7x + 3, the 2 in front of x² makes things a bit more challenging."

**Method 1: Grouping method**

1. Multiply a × c (the first and last coefficients)
2. Find two numbers that multiply to give a × c and add to give b (the middle coefficient)
3. Split the middle term using these numbers
4. Factor by grouping

**Example walkthrough:**

**Factor**: 2x² + 7x + 3

> **Solution Walkthrough**
>
> #### Step 1: Identify and multiply the coefficients
> - First coefficient (a) = 2
> - Last coefficient (c) = 3
> - a × c = 2 × 3 = 6
>
> #### Step 2: Find the special pair of numbers
> - We need two numbers that multiply to give 6 and add to give 7
> - Possible pairs that multiply to 6: (1,6), (2,3), (-1,-6), (-2,-3)
> - The pair (1,6) works because 1 × 6 = 6 and 1 + 6 = 7
>
> #### Step 3: Split the middle term using these numbers
> - Original expression: 2x² + 7x + 3
> - Split middle term: 2x² + 1x + 6x + 3
>
> #### Step 4: Factor by grouping
> - Group related terms: (2x² + 1x) + (6x + 3)
> - Factor out common factors: x(2x + 1) + 3(2x + 1)
> - Factor out the common binomial: (2x + 1)(x + 3)
>
> #### Answer
> (2x + 1)(x + 3)

**Method 2: Trial and error with the AC method**

**Example walkthrough:**

**Factor**: 3x² - 10x + 8

> **Solution Walkthrough**
>
> #### Step 1: Identify and multiply the coefficients
> - First coefficient (a) = 3
> - Last coefficient (c) = 8
> - a × c = 3 × 8 = 24
>
> #### Step 2: Find the special pair of numbers
> - We need two numbers that multiply to give 24 and add to give -10
> - Possible pairs that multiply to 24: (1,24), (2,12), (3,8), (4,6), (-1,-24), (-2,-12), (-3,-8), (-4,-6)
> - The pair (-4,-6) works because (-4) × (-6) = 24 and (-4) + (-6) = -10
>
> #### Step 3: Split the middle term using these numbers
> - Original expression: 3x² - 10x + 8
> - Split middle term: 3x² - 4x - 6x + 8
>
> #### Step 4: Factor by grouping
> - Group related terms: (3x² - 4x) + (-6x + 8)
> - Factor out common factors: x(3x - 4) - 2(3x - 4)

3. 3x² + x - 2

### 3. Factoring by Substitution

**Simple explanation:** "Sometimes expressions look complicated, but we can simplify them by treating certain parts as a single variable."

**Example 1: Quadratic-like expressions**

**Factor**: x⁴ - 5x² + 4

> **Solution Walkthrough**
> 
> #### Step 1: Make a substitution
> - Let u = x²
> - This transforms the expression into a standard quadratic form
>
> #### Step 2: Rewrite the expression with the new variable
> - Original: x⁴ - 5x² + 4
> - With substitution: u² - 5u + 4
>
> #### Step 3: Factor the simplified expression
> - Factor the quadratic: u² - 5u + 4
> - This factors as: (u - 1)(u - 4)
>
> #### Step 4: Substitute back the original variable
> - Replace u with x²: (x² - 1)(x² - 4)
>
> #### Step 5: Factor further if possible
> - Factor x² - 1 = (x + 1)(x - 1) [difference of squares]
> - Factor x² - 4 = (x + 2)(x - 2) [difference of squares]
> - Final result: (x + 1)(x - 1)(x + 2)(x - 2)

**Example 2: With a different substitution**

**Factor**: 2(x + 3)² - 7(x + 3) + 3

> **Solution Walkthrough**
> 
> #### Step 1: Identify a repeated expression to substitute
> - Notice the expression (x + 3) appears multiple times
> - Let u = (x + 3)
>
> #### Step 2: Rewrite using the substitution
> - Original: 2(x + 3)² - 7(x + 3) + 3
> - With substitution: 2u² - 7u + 3
>
> #### Step 3: Factor the simplified expression
> - Factor the quadratic: 2u² - 7u + 3
> - This factors as: (2u - 1)(u - 3)
>
> #### Step 4: Substitute back the original expression
> - Replace u with (x + 3): (2(x + 3) - 1)((x + 3) - 3)
>
> #### Step 5: Simplify the final expression
> - Expand: (2x + 6 - 1)(x + 3 - 3)
> - Combine like terms: (2x + 5)(x)
> - Final result: x(2x + 5)

### 4. Factoring Sum and Difference of Cubes

**Simple explanation:** "Just like there's a special pattern for the difference of squares, there are patterns for working with cubes."

**Key formulas to memorize:**
- Difference of cubes: a³ - b³ = (a - b)(a² + ab + b²)
- Sum of cubes: a³ + b³ = (a + b)(a² - ab + b²)

**Example 1: Difference of cubes**

**Factor**: x³ - 27

> **Solution Walkthrough**
> 
> #### Step 1: Identify the expression as a difference of cubes
> - Original: x³ - 27
> - Rewrite as: x³ - 3³ (since 27 = 3³)
>
> #### Step 2: Apply the difference of cubes formula
> - Formula: a³ - b³ = (a - b)(a² + ab + b²)
> - Substitute a = x and b = 3
> - Result: (x - 3)(x² + x⋅3 + 3²)
>
> #### Step 3: Simplify the final expression
> - Compute: 3² = 9
> - Final result: (x - 3)(x² + 3x + 9)

**Example 2: Sum of cubes**

**Factor**: 8x³ + 125

> **Solution Walkthrough**
> 
> #### Step 1: Identify the expression as a sum of cubes
> - Original: 8x³ + 125
> - Note that 8x³ = (2x)³ (since 2³ = 8)
> - Note that 125 = 5³
> - Rewrite as: (2x)³ + 5³
>
> #### Step 2: Apply the sum of cubes formula
> - Formula: a³ + b³ = (a + b)(a² - ab + b²)
> - Substitute a = 2x and b = 5
> - Result: (2x + 5)((2x)² - (2x)(5) + 5²)
>
> #### Step 3: Simplify the final expression
> - Compute: (2x)² = 4x²
> - Compute: (2x)(5) = 10x
> - Compute: 5² = 25
> - Final result: (2x + 5)(4x² - 10x + 25)

### 5. Complex Polynomial Factoring Strategy

**General strategy for factoring complex polynomials:**

1. Check for common factors first
2. Identify the type of expression:
   - Difference of squares: a² - b²
   - Sum/difference of cubes: a³ ± b³
   - Trinomial: ax² + bx + c
   - Other: Consider substitution
3. After factoring, check if any of the factors can be factored further
4. Verify by multiplying the factors

**Example of a multi-step factoring:**
```
Factor completely: 2x⁵ - 32x³

Step 1: Factor out common term: 2x³(x² - 16)
Step 2: Factor the difference of squares: 2x³(x + 4)(x - 4)
```

```
Factor completely: x⁴ - 16

Step 1: Factor as difference of squares: (x² + 4)(x² - 4)
Step 2: Factor the second term further: (x² + 4)(x + 2)(x - 2)
```

### 6. Factoring Strategy Summary

**Decision tree for factoring:**

1. Check for GCF (Greatest Common Factor)
2. How many terms?
   - 2 terms: Check for difference of squares (a² - b²), sum/difference of cubes (a³ ± b³)
   - 3 terms: Try factoring as a trinomial
   - 4 terms: Try factoring by grouping
3. Look for substitution opportunities
4. Factor each resulting expression recursively
5. Verify your answer by multiplying the factors

6. Let u = (x - 3), then 2u² + 5u - 3 = (2u - 1)(u + 3) = (2(x - 3) - 1)((x - 3) + 3) = (2x - 7)(x)
7. 4x²(x² - 1) = 4x²(x + 1)(x - 1)
