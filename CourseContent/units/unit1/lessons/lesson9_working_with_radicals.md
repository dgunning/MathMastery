# Working with Radicals

### Radical expressions represent roots of numbers

## Why This Matters

**Real-World Applications:**
- **Engineering & Architecture:** Ever wonder how engineers ensure buildings don't collapse? When designing structures like bridges and skyscrapers, they use radical expressions to calculate load distributions, stress points, and material requirements. The Golden Gate Bridge's suspension system was designed using radical calculations.

- **Computer Graphics & Gaming:** Video games and CGI movies calculate distances between objects using the distance formula (which contains a square root). When you see realistic 3D movement in games like Fortnite or Minecraft, you're witnessing radical expressions at work - calculating thousands of distances per second.

- **Medical Imaging Technology:** MRI machines and CT scanners rely on complex algorithms with radical expressions to create detailed images of your body. Medical technicians who understand these principles earn $70,000+ annually helping save lives through precise imaging.

- **Sound Engineering:** Music producers and audio engineers use radical expressions when designing speakers, concert venues, and recording studios to ensure perfect acoustics. The exact timing of sound waves (which involves square roots in the calculations) determines whether a concert hall sounds magnificent or terrible.

**Career Connection:** Professions that regularly use radical expressions include engineering ($90,000+), computer science ($105,000+), medical technology ($75,000+), and scientific research ($85,000+). Companies like Boeing, NVIDIA, Siemens Medical, and Dolby Labs specifically seek candidates comfortable with these mathematical concepts.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Understanding Radical Expressions

**Simple explanation:** "A radical expression contains a square root (√), cube root (∛), or other root symbol. The number under the radical is called the radicand."

**Key terms:**
- **Radical symbol (√)**: The symbol indicating a root
- **Radicand**: The expression under the radical sign
- **Index**: The small number written to the left of the radical that indicates which root (default is 2 for square root)

**Examples:**
- √25 (square root of 25)
- ∛8 (cube root of 8)
- √x (square root of x)
- ∜16 (fourth root of 16)

**Connection to powers:** "Radicals are the opposite of powers. For example:
- √25 = 5 because 5² = 25
- ∛8 = 2 because 2³ = 8
- ∜16 = 2 because 2⁴ = 16"

**Visual representation:** "You can think of a square root as finding the side length of a square with a given area. For example, √25 = 5 means a square with area 25 has sides of length 5."

### 2. Simplifying Radical Expressions

**Simple explanation:** "Simplifying a radical means rewriting it in a cleaner form by taking out any perfect square factors from under the radical."

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Find the largest perfect square factor of the radicand
2. Take the square root of that factor and bring it outside the radical
3. Leave the remaining factor inside the radical

**Example**: Simplify √50

> **Solution Walkthrough**
> 
> #### Step 1: Identify the radicand and look for perfect square factors
> - The radicand is 50
> - Find factors of 50: 50 = 25 × 2
> - 25 is a perfect square (5² = 25)
>
> #### Step 2: Apply the product property of square roots
> - Use the property: √(a × b) = √a × √b
> - √50 = √(25 × 2) = √25 × √2
>
> #### Step 3: Simplify the perfect square
> - √25 = 5 (because 5² = 25)
> - This gives us: 5√2
>
> #### Step 4: Express the final answer in simplified form
> - The simplified form of √50 is 5√2
> - This is now in standard form with the radical term containing no perfect square factors

**Example**: Simplify √72

> **Solution Walkthrough**
> 
> #### Step 1: Identify the radicand and look for perfect square factors
> - The radicand is 72
> - Find different factorizations of 72:
>   * 72 = 36 × 2
>   * 72 = 4 × 18
>   * 72 = 4 × 9 × 2
> - Choose the factorization with the largest perfect square: 72 = 36 × 2
> - 36 is a perfect square (6² = 36)
>
> #### Step 2: Apply the product property of square roots
> - Use the property: √(a × b) = √a × √b
> - √72 = √(36 × 2) = √36 × √2
>
> #### Step 3: Simplify the perfect square
> - √36 = 6 (because 6² = 36)
> - This gives us: 6√2
>
> #### Step 4: Express the final answer in simplified form
> - The simplified form of √72 is 6√2
> - We've taken out all possible perfect square factors from the radicand

**Key insight:** "When simplifying radicals, we're not changing their value, just their form. 5√2 equals √50; we've just expressed it in a more standard form."

### 3. Rationalizing Denominators

**Simple explanation:** "We usually don't leave radicals in the denominator of a fraction. Rationalizing means rewriting the fraction to remove the radical from the denominator."

**Why it matters:** "This creates a standard form that's easier to work with and compare. It's a mathematical convention that makes further calculations simpler."

**Step-by-step process for single term:**
1. Multiply both numerator and denominator by the radical in the denominator
2. Simplify the resulting expression

**Example**: Rationalize 3/√5

> **Solution Walkthrough**
> 
> #### Step 1: Identify the radical in the denominator
> - The fraction is 3/√5
> - The denominator contains a radical: √5
>
> #### Step 2: Apply the rationalization technique
> - To rationalize, multiply both numerator and denominator by √5
> - This works because √5 × √5 = 5 (a rational number)
> - 3/√5 × √5/√5 = 3√5/(√5 × √5)
>
> #### Step 3: Simplify the denominator
> - The denominator becomes √5 × √5 = 5
> - This gives us: 3√5/5
>
> #### Step 4: Express in standard rationalized form
> - The rationalized form is 3√5/5
> - We can further simplify if needed by dividing both numerator and denominator by any common factors
>
> #### Step 5: Verify the result
> - The original expression 3/√5 and the rationalized form 3√5/5 are equivalent
> - The denominator no longer contains any radicals

**Step-by-step process for binomial denominators:**
1. Multiply both numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator
2. Simplify using the difference of squares: (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b²

**Example**: Rationalize 2/(3 + √2)

> **Solution Walkthrough**
> 
> #### Step 1: Identify the binomial expression in the denominator
> - The fraction is 2/(3 + √2)
> - The denominator contains a binomial with a radical: 3 + √2
>
> #### Step 2: Find the conjugate of the denominator
> - The conjugate of a binomial a + b is a - b
> - The conjugate of 3 + √2 is 3 - √2
>
> #### Step 3: Apply the rationalization technique
> - Multiply both numerator and denominator by the conjugate: (3 - √2)/(3 - √2)
> - 2/(3 + √2) × (3 - √2)/(3 - √2) = 2(3 - √2)/((3 + √2)(3 - √2))
>
> #### Step 4: Simplify the denominator using the difference of squares formula
> - Using (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b²
> - (3 + √2)(3 - √2) = 3² - (√2)² = 9 - 2 = 7
> - This gives us: 2(3 - √2)/7
>
> #### Step 5: Distribute in the numerator
> - 2(3 - √2)/7 = (6 - 2√2)/7
>
> #### Step 6: Express in standard rationalized form
> - The rationalized form is (6 - 2√2)/7
> - The denominator is now a rational number with no radicals

**Common mistake to avoid:** "Don't just multiply the denominator by the radical. You must multiply both the numerator and denominator by the same value to keep the fraction equivalent."

### 4. Adding and Subtracting Radical Expressions

**Simple explanation:** "We can only add or subtract radical expressions if they have the same radical part. It's like adding similar terms in algebra."

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Simplify each radical expression
2. Combine like radicals (those with the same radicand)
3. Keep unlike radicals separate

**Example**: Simplify 3√8 + 2√18

> **Solution Walkthrough**
> 
> #### Step 1: Identify the radical expressions to be added
> - We need to add 3√8 and 2√18
> - Note that these radicals look different, but we need to check if they can be simplified to like radicals
>
> #### Step 2: Simplify the first radical expression
> - For 3√8, identify perfect square factors: 8 = 4 × 2
> - 4 is a perfect square (2² = 4)
> - Apply the product property: 3√8 = 3√(4 × 2) = 3 × 2√2 = 6√2
>
> #### Step 3: Simplify the second radical expression
> - For 2√18, identify perfect square factors: 18 = 9 × 2
> - 9 is a perfect square (3² = 9)
> - Apply the product property: 2√18 = 2√(9 × 2) = 2 × 3√2 = 6√2
>
> #### Step 4: Identify like radicals and combine
> - Both expressions have simplified to the same radical term √2
> - We have 6√2 + 6√2 = 12√2
>
> #### Step 5: Express the final answer
> - The simplified sum is 12√2
> - This shows why it's important to simplify before attempting to combine radical expressions

**Example**: Simplify 5√12 - 2√27

> **Solution Walkthrough**
> 
> #### Step 1: Identify the radical expressions to be subtracted
> - We need to subtract 2√27 from 5√12
> - We must first check if these can be simplified to like radicals
>
> #### Step 2: Simplify the first radical expression
> - For 5√12, identify perfect square factors: 12 = 4 × 3
> - 4 is a perfect square (2² = 4)
> - Apply the product property: 5√12 = 5√(4 × 3) = 5 × 2√3 = 10√3
>
> #### Step 3: Simplify the second radical expression
> - For 2√27, identify perfect square factors: 27 = 9 × 3
> - 9 is a perfect square (3² = 9)
> - Apply the product property: 2√27 = 2√(9 × 3) = 2 × 3√3 = 6√3
>
> #### Step 4: Identify like radicals and combine
> - Both expressions have simplified to the same radical term √3
> - We have 10√3 - 6√3 = 4√3
>
> #### Step 5: Express the final answer
> - The simplified difference is 4√3
> - This shows the importance of simplifying before combining radical terms

**Example**: Simplify √8 + √50 - √18

> **Solution Walkthrough**
> 
> #### Step 1: Identify the radical expressions to be combined
> - We need to simplify the expression √8 + √50 - √18
> - All three terms contain square roots with different radicands
>
> #### Step 2: Simplify each radical expression
> - For √8, identify perfect square factors: 8 = 4 × 2
> - 4 is a perfect square (2² = 4)
> - Therefore: √8 = √(4 × 2) = 2√2
>
> #### Step 3: Simplify the second radical expression
> - For √50, identify perfect square factors: 50 = 25 × 2
> - 25 is a perfect square (5² = 25)
> - Therefore: √50 = √(25 × 2) = 5√2
>
> #### Step 4: Simplify the third radical expression
> - For √18, identify perfect square factors: 18 = 9 × 2
> - 9 is a perfect square (3² = 9)
> - Therefore: √18 = √(9 × 2) = 3√2
>
> #### Step 5: Identify like radicals and combine
> - All three expressions have simplified to the same radical term √2
> - Combine the coefficients: 2 + 5 - 3 = 4
> - This gives us: 2√2 + 5√2 - 3√2 = 4√2
>
> #### Step 6: Express the final answer
> - The simplified expression is 4√2
> - Notice how simplifying first revealed that all three terms were actually like radicals

**Key insight:** "Think of √2, √3, etc., as different 'types' of terms. You can only combine the coefficients of terms of the same 'type.'"

### 5. Multiplying Radical Expressions

**Simple explanation:** "To multiply radical expressions, we multiply the numbers outside the radicals together, and the numbers inside the radicals together."

**Basic rule:** "√a × √b = √(a × b)"

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Multiply the coefficients
2. Multiply the radicands
3. Simplify the resulting radical if possible

**Example**: Multiply 3√5 × 2√7

> **Solution Walkthrough**
> 
> #### Step 1: Identify the components of each radical expression
> - First expression: 3√5 has coefficient 3 and radicand 5
> - Second expression: 2√7 has coefficient 2 and radicand 7
>
> #### Step 2: Multiply the coefficients
> - Multiply the numbers outside the radicals: 3 × 2 = 6
>
> #### Step 3: Multiply the radicands
> - Apply the product property: √5 × √7 = √(5 × 7) = √35
> - The product property states that √a × √b = √(a × b)
>
> #### Step 4: Combine the results
> - Put the coefficient and radical together: 6√35
>
> #### Step 5: Check if the radical can be simplified
> - 35 has no perfect square factors, so 6√35 cannot be simplified further
>
> #### Step 6: Express the final answer
> - The product of 3√5 and 2√7 is 6√35

**Example**: Multiply √12 × √6

> **Solution Walkthrough**
> 
> #### Step 1: Identify the radical expressions to multiply
> - First expression: √12
> - Second expression: √6
> - Note that neither has a coefficient outside the radical
>
> #### Step 2: Apply the product property of radicals
> - Use the property: √a × √b = √(a × b)
> - √12 × √6 = √(12 × 6) = √72
>
> #### Step 3: Simplify the resulting radical
> - Look for perfect square factors in 72
> - 72 = 36 × 2, where 36 = 6² is a perfect square
> - √72 = √(36 × 2) = √36 × √2 = 6√2
>
> #### Step 4: Express the final answer
> - The product of √12 and √6 is 6√2
> - Notice that the result is simpler than the original expressions

**Example**: Multiply (3 + √5)(2 - √5)

> **Solution Walkthrough**
> 
> #### Step 1: Identify the binomial expressions
> - First expression: (3 + √5)
> - Second expression: (2 - √5)
> - Notice that the second term in each binomial contains the same radical, but with opposite signs
>
> #### Step 2: Apply the FOIL method for multiplying binomials
> - **F**irst terms: 3 × 2 = 6
> - **O**uter terms: 3 × (-√5) = -3√5
> - **I**nner terms: √5 × 2 = 2√5
> - **L**ast terms: √5 × (-√5) = -(√5)² = -5
>
> #### Step 3: Express the expanded form
> - Combining all terms: 6 - 3√5 + 2√5 - 5
>
> #### Step 4: Combine like terms
> - Combine the constant terms: 6 - 5 = 1
> - Combine the radical terms: -3√5 + 2√5 = -√5
> - Final result: 1 - √5
>
> #### Step 5: Recognize the pattern
> - Note that this is a special case of the difference of squares formula: (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b²
> - If we had recognized this pattern at the beginning, we could have directly calculated:
> - (3 + √5)(3 - √5) = 3² - (√5)² = 9 - 5 = 4
> - However, our specific problem had (3 + √5)(2 - √5), which doesn't precisely fit this pattern

**Special pattern to recognize:** "(a + b)(a - b) = a² - b² works with radicals too!"

### 6. Dividing Radical Expressions

**Simple explanation:** "Division with radicals often involves rationalizing the denominator."

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Write as a fraction
2. Rationalize the denominator
3. Simplify the result

**Example**: Divide 6√8 by 2√2

> **Solution Walkthrough**
> 
> #### Step 1: Express the division as a fraction
> - We need to divide 6√8 by 2√2
> - Write this as a fraction: $\frac{6\sqrt{8}}{2\sqrt{2}}$
>
> #### Step 2: Simplify the numerical coefficients
> - Divide the coefficients: $\frac{6}{2} = 3$
> - This gives us: $3\frac{\sqrt{8}}{\sqrt{2}}$
>
> #### Step 3: Apply the radical division rule
> - For square roots: $\frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}} = \sqrt{\frac{a}{b}}$ (when both $a$ and $b$ are positive)
> - Using this rule: $\frac{\sqrt{8}}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{8}{2}} = \sqrt{4}$
>
> #### Step 4: Simplify the resulting radical
> - Since $\sqrt{4} = 2$ (as $2^2 = 4$)
> - We now have: $3 \times 2 = 6$
>
> #### Step 5: Express the final answer
> - The result of dividing 6√8 by 2√2 is 6

**Example**: Divide √12 by √3

> **Solution Walkthrough**
> 
> #### Step 1: Express the division as a fraction
> - We need to divide √12 by √3
> - Write this as a fraction: $\frac{\sqrt{12}}{\sqrt{3}}$
>
> #### Step 2: Apply the radical division rule
> - For square roots: $\frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}} = \sqrt{\frac{a}{b}}$ (when both $a$ and $b$ are positive)
> - Using this rule: $\frac{\sqrt{12}}{\sqrt{3}} = \sqrt{\frac{12}{3}}$
>
> #### Step 3: Simplify the fraction inside the radical
> - Calculate: $\frac{12}{3} = 4$
> - This gives us: $\sqrt{4}$
>
> #### Step 4: Calculate the simplified radical
> - Since 4 is a perfect square ($2^2 = 4$)
> - $\sqrt{4} = 2$
>
> #### Step 5: Express the final answer
> - The result of dividing √12 by √3 is 2
> - Note how the division rule allowed us to simplify this expression without having to rationalize the denominator

### 7. Solving Radical Equations

**Simple explanation:** "A radical equation contains a variable inside a radical. To solve it, we need to isolate the radical and then square both sides (or raise to the appropriate power)."

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Isolate the radical term on one side
2. Square both sides (or apply appropriate power)
3. Solve the resulting equation
4. Check all solutions in the original equation (squaring can introduce extraneous roots)

**Example**: Solve √(2x - 3) = 5

> **Solution Walkthrough**
> 
> #### Step 1: Analyze the equation
> - The equation is √(2x - 3) = 5
> - We have a square root containing the expression (2x - 3) on the left side
> - We have a constant value 5 on the right side
>
> #### Step 2: Isolate the radical term
> - The radical term √(2x - 3) is already isolated on the left side
>
> #### Step 3: Square both sides of the equation
> - Squaring both sides eliminates the radical: (√(2x - 3))² = 5²
> - This simplifies to: 2x - 3 = 25
>
> #### Step 4: Solve the resulting equation
> - Adding 3 to both sides: 2x = 28
> - Dividing both sides by 2: x = 14
>
> #### Step 5: Check the solution
> - Substitute x = 14 back into the original equation
> - √(2(14) - 3) = √(28 - 3) = √25 = 5
> - Since 5 = 5, the solution x = 14 is valid
>
> #### Step 6: State the final answer
> - The solution to the equation √(2x - 3) = 5 is x = 14

**Example**: Solve √(x + 1) = x - 5

> **Solution Walkthrough**
> 
> #### Step 1: Analyze the equation
> - The equation is √(x + 1) = x - 5
> - We have a square root on the left side and a linear expression on the right
> - This is more complex than our previous example because the variable appears on both sides
>
> #### Step 2: Isolate the radical term
> - The radical term √(x + 1) is already isolated on the left side
>
> #### Step 3: Square both sides of the equation
> - Squaring both sides eliminates the radical: (√(x + 1))² = (x - 5)²
> - Left side: x + 1
> - Right side: (x - 5)² = x² - 10x + 25
> - This gives us: x + 1 = x² - 10x + 25
>
> #### Step 4: Rearrange into standard form
> - Subtracting x + 1 from both sides: 0 = x² - 10x + 25 - x - 1
> - Simplifying: 0 = x² - 11x + 24
>
> #### Step 5: Solve the resulting quadratic equation
> - Factoring: 0 = (x - 8)(x - 3)
> - Setting each factor to zero: x - 8 = 0 or x - 3 = 0
> - This gives potential solutions: x = 8 or x = 3
>
> #### Step 6: Check both solutions in the original equation
> - For x = 8:
>   * Left side: √(8 + 1) = √9 = 3
>   * Right side: 8 - 5 = 3
>   * Since 3 = 3, x = 8 is a valid solution
> - For x = 3:
>   * Left side: √(3 + 1) = √4 = 2
>   * Right side: 3 - 5 = -2
>   * Since 2 ≠ -2, x = 3 is not a valid solution (it's an extraneous solution)
>
> #### Step 7: State the final answer
> - After checking, we confirm that only x = 8 is a valid solution
> - This example demonstrates why checking solutions is critical when solving radical equations

**Common mistake to avoid:** "Always check your answers in the original equation, as squaring both sides can introduce solutions that don't work."

### 8. Applications of Radical Expressions

**Simple explanation:** "Radical expressions appear in many real-world scenarios, especially in geometry, physics, and finance."

**Geometric applications:**
- "The diagonal of a square with side length s is s√2"
- "The height of an equilateral triangle with side length s is (s√3)/2"

**Example**: The diagonal of a square TV screen is 50 inches. What is the width of the screen?

> **Solution Walkthrough**
> 
> #### Step 1: Identify the relationship between width and diagonal
> - In a square, if the width (and height) is w, the diagonal length is w√2
> - This comes from the Pythagorean theorem: d² = w² + w² = 2w², so d = w√2
>
> #### Step 2: Set up an equation using the given information
> - We know the diagonal is 50 inches
> - Therefore: w√2 = 50
>
> #### Step 3: Solve for the width
> - Divide both sides by √2: w = 50/√2
> - Rationalize the denominator by multiplying by √2/√2: w = (50 × √2)/(√2 × √2) = 50√2/2 = 25√2
>
> #### Step 4: Calculate the approximate decimal value
> - √2 ≈ 1.414
> - w = 25√2 ≈ 25 × 1.414 ≈ 35.4 inches
>
> #### Step 5: State the final answer
> - The width of the square TV screen is 25√2 inches, or approximately 35.4 inches

**Example**: In a right triangle, if the legs are 5 and 7 units, what is the length of the hypotenuse?

> **Solution Walkthrough**
> 
> #### Step 1: Identify the known values
> - We have a right triangle with legs of lengths 5 and 7 units
> - We need to find the length of the hypotenuse
>
> #### Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean theorem
> - The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, a² + b² = c², where c is the hypotenuse
> - Substituting our values: 5² + 7² = c²
>
> #### Step 3: Calculate the value under the radical
> - 5² = 25
> - 7² = 49
> - 25 + 49 = 74
> - Therefore, c² = 74
>
> #### Step 4: Take the square root to find the hypotenuse
> - c = √74
>
> #### Step 5: Examine if the radical can be simplified
> - Check for perfect square factors of 74
> - The prime factorization of 74 is 2 × 37
> - Since there are no perfect square factors, √74 cannot be simplified further
>
> #### Step 6: Express the final answer
> - The length of the hypotenuse is √74 units (exact form)
> - As a decimal approximation: √74 ≈ 8.60 units

**Example**: The period T of a pendulum with length L is given by T = 2π√(L/g), where g is the acceleration due to gravity. If a pendulum is 2 meters long, what is its period on Earth where g = 9.8 m/s²?

> **Solution Walkthrough**
> 
> #### Step 1: Identify the relevant formula and values
> - The formula for the period of a pendulum is T = 2π√(L/g)
> - Given: L = 2 meters, g = 9.8 m/s²
>
> #### Step 2: Substitute the values into the formula
> - T = 2π√(2/9.8)
>
> #### Step 3: Calculate the value under the radical
> - 2/9.8 ≈ 0.204
>
> #### Step 4: Calculate the square root
> - √0.204 ≈ 0.452
>
> #### Step 5: Complete the calculation
> - T = 2π × 0.452
> - T ≈ 2 × 3.14159 × 0.452
> - T ≈ 2.84 seconds
>
> #### Step 6: Express the final answer
> - The period of the 2-meter pendulum is approximately 2.84 seconds
> - This demonstrates how radical expressions are essential in physics calculations

   - √x = 6
   - √(2x + 3) = 4
   - √x + 2 = x

**Solutions:**
1. Simplifying:
   - √20 = √(4 × 5) = 2√5
   - √48 = √(16 × 3) = 4√3
   - √160 = √(16 × 10) = 4√10
   - √45 = √(9 × 5) = 3√5

2. Rationalizing:
   - 5/√2 = 5/√2 × √2/√2 = 5√2/2
   - 3/√12 = 3/√12 × √12/√12 = 3√12/12 = 3√12/12 = 3√3/6 = √3/2
   - 4/(2 + √3) = 4(2 - √3)/((2)² - (√3)²) = 4(2 - √3)/(4 - 3) = 4(2 - √3)
   - 1/(√5 - √2) = (√5 + √2)/((√5)² - (√2)²) = (√5 + √2)/(5 - 2) = (√5 + √2)/3

3. Adding/subtracting:
   - 2√12 + 3√27 = 2(2√3) + 3(3√3) = 4√3 + 9√3 = 13√3
   - 4√50 - 2√32 = 4(5√2) - 2(4√2) = 20√2 - 8√2 = 12√2
   - 3√28 + 2√63 - √7 = 3(2√7) + 2(3√7) - √7 = 6√7 + 6√7 - √7 = 11√7

4. Multiplying:
   - 3√2 × 4√6 = 12√12 = 12(2√3) = 24√3
   - √15 × √5 = √75 = √(25 × 3) = 5√3
   - (5 + 2√3)(5 - 2√3) = 5² - (2√3)² = 25 - 12 = 13

5. Equations:
   - √x = 6, so x = 36
   - √(2x + 3) = 4, so 2x + 3 = 16, thus x = 6.5
   - √x + 2 = x, so (√x)² = (x - 2)², thus x = x² - 4x + 4, which gives x² - 5x + 4 = 0, factoring to (x - 1)(x - 4) = 0, so x = 1 or x = 4. Checking: for x = 1: √1 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3, but 1 ≠ 3, so reject. For x = 4: √4 + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4, which equals 4, so x = 4 is the only solution.
