    "explanation": "A quadratic function has the form f(x) = ax² + bx + c, where a ≠ 0. Key features include:\n\n1. Graph: Always a parabola\n   - Opens upward if a > 0\n   - Opens downward if a < 0\n\n2. Key points:\n   - Vertex: The highest or lowest point at x = -b/(2a)\n   - y-intercept: At (0, c)\n   - x-intercepts: Where f(x) = 0, found by solving the quadratic equation\n\n3. Solving quadratic equations:\n   - Factoring: If ax² + bx + c = 0, find factors and set each to zero\n   - Quadratic formula: x = (-b ± √(b²-4ac))/(2a)\n   - Completing the square",
    "example": "For f(x) = 2x² - 4x - 6:\n\n- Vertex at x = -b/(2a) = -(-4)/(2⋅2) = 4/4 = 1\n  Vertex y-value: f(1) = 2(1)² - 4(1) - 6 = 2 - 4 - 6 = -8\n  Vertex: (1, -8)\n\n- y-intercept at (0, -6)\n\n- x-intercepts: Solve 2x² - 4x - 6 = 0\n  Using quadratic formula: x = (-(-4) ± √((-4)²-4⋅2⋅(-6)))/(2⋅2)\n  x = (4 ± √(16+48))/4 = (4 ± √64)/4 = (4 ± 8)/4\n  x = 3 or x = -1",
    "key_point": "The form f(x) = a(x - h)² + k is the vertex form, where (h, k) is the vertex. This form is useful for directly identifying the vertex and determining the direction of opening."
