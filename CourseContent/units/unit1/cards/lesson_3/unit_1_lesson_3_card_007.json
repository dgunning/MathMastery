  "duration": 180,
  "content": {
    "explanation": "Sometimes expressions look complex, but we can make them simpler by treating certain parts as a single variable. This is called substitution.\n\nFor example, x\u2074 - 5x\u00b2 + 4 looks complicated, but if we let u = x\u00b2, it becomes:\nu\u00b2 - 5u + 4\n\nThis is much easier to factor!",
    "example": "Think of substitution like using a nickname for a long name - it makes everything simpler to work with.",
    "key_point": "Substitution transforms complex-looking problems into familiar ones we already know how to solve."
