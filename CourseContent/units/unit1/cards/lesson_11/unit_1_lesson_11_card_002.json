    "explanation": "The discriminant (\u0394 = b\u00b2 - 4ac) of a quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0 determines the number and type of roots the equation has. There are three possible cases:\n\n1. Positive Discriminant (\u0394 > 0):\n   - The equation has two distinct real roots\n   - The roots are given by x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a\u0394)/(2a)\n   - On a graph, the parabola crosses the x-axis at two different points\n\n2. Zero Discriminant (\u0394 = 0):\n   - The equation has one repeated real root (a double root)\n   - The root is given by x = -b/(2a)\n   - On a graph, the parabola touches (is tangent to) the x-axis at exactly one point\n   - The equation can be written as a perfect square: a(x - r)\u00b2\n\n3. Negative Discriminant (\u0394 < 0):\n   - The equation has two complex conjugate roots\n   - The roots are given by x = (-b \u00b1 i\u221a|\u0394|)/(2a), where i = \u221a(-1)\n   - On a graph, the parabola doesn't intersect the x-axis at all\n\nThe discriminant also provides information about whether the quadratic expression can be factored with real numbers. If \u0394 \u2265 0, the expression can be factored with real coefficients; if \u0394 < 0, it cannot.",
    "example": "Let's examine three quadratic equations with different discriminants:\n\n1. x\u00b2 - 5x + 6 = 0\n   Discriminant: \u0394 = (-5)\u00b2 - 4(1)(6) = 25 - 24 = 1 > 0\n   This equation has two distinct real roots: x = 2 and x = 3\n   The factored form is (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0\n\n2. x\u00b2 - 6x + 9 = 0\n   Discriminant: \u0394 = (-6)\u00b2 - 4(1)(9) = 36 - 36 = 0\n   This equation has one repeated root: x = 3\n   The factored form is (x - 3)\u00b2 = 0\n\n3. x\u00b2 + x + 1 = 0\n   Discriminant: \u0394 = 1\u00b2 - 4(1)(1) = 1 - 4 = -3 < 0\n   This equation has two complex conjugate roots: x = -1/2 \u00b1 i\u221a3/2\n   The expression cannot be factored using real numbers",
    "key_point": "The sign of the discriminant immediately tells you the nature of the roots without requiring you to solve the equation completely. This makes it a valuable tool for analyzing quadratic equations and their corresponding functions."
