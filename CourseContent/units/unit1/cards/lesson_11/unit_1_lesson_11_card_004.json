    "problem": "For each of the following quadratic equations:\n1. Determine the discriminant\n2. Describe the nature of the roots\n3. Find the roots\n\nEquations:\na) x\u00b2 + 6x + 9 = 0\nb) 2x\u00b2 - 5x - 3 = 0\nc) x\u00b2 + x + 1 = 0",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: For equation a) x\u00b2 + 6x + 9 = 0, identify the coefficients: a = 1, b = 6, c = 9.",
      "Step 2: Calculate the discriminant for equation a):\n\u0394 = b\u00b2 - 4ac\n\u0394 = 6\u00b2 - 4(1)(9)\n\u0394 = 36 - 36\n\u0394 = 0",
      "Step 3: Since \u0394 = 0, equation a) has one repeated real root (a double root). The root is x = -b/(2a) = -6/(2(1)) = -3. We can verify this is correct by factoring: x\u00b2 + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)\u00b2.",

      "Step 5: Calculate the discriminant for equation b):\n\u0394 = b\u00b2 - 4ac\n\u0394 = (-5)\u00b2 - 4(2)(-3)\n\u0394 = 25 + 24\n\u0394 = 49",
      "Step 6: Since \u0394 = 49 > 0, equation b) has two distinct real roots. Using the quadratic formula:\nx = (-b \u00b1 \u221a\u0394)/(2a)\nx = (5 \u00b1 \u221a49)/(2(2))\nx = (5 \u00b1 7)/4\nx = 3 or x = -1/2\nWe can verify by factoring: 2x\u00b2 - 5x - 3 = (2x - 3)(x + 1) = 0.",

      "Step 9: Since \u0394 = -3 < 0, equation c) has two complex conjugate roots. Using the quadratic formula:\nx = (-b \u00b1 i\u221a|\u0394|)/(2a)\nx = (-1 \u00b1 i\u221a3)/(2(1))\nx = -1/2 \u00b1 (\u221a3/2)i\nThese are complex numbers with real part -1/2 and imaginary part \u00b1\u221a3/2."
    ],
    "explanation": "The discriminant not only tells us the nature of the roots but also helps us determine the most efficient method for finding them:\n\n1. When \u0394 = 0 (zero discriminant):\n   - The equation has one repeated root: x = -b/(2a)\n   - The quadratic expression is a perfect square trinomial: a(x + b/(2a))\u00b2\n   - Example: x\u00b2 + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)\u00b2\n\n2. When \u0394 > 0 (positive discriminant):\n   - The equation has two distinct real roots\n   - If \u0394 is a perfect square, the roots are rational and the expression can be factored with rational coefficients\n   - If \u0394 is not a perfect square, the roots are irrational\n   - Example: 2x\u00b2 - 5x - 3 = (2x - 3)(x + 1)\n\n3. When \u0394 < 0 (negative discriminant):\n   - The equation has two complex conjugate roots\n   - The expression cannot be factored with real coefficients\n   - Example: x\u00b2 + x + 1 cannot be factored with real numbers"
