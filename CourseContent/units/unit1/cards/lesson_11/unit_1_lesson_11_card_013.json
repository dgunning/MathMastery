    "explanation": "The discriminant is an integral part of the quadratic formula and provides important insights into the nature of the solutions before we even complete the calculation.\n\nRecall that for a quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, the quadratic formula gives the solutions as:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac))/(2a)\n\nThe expression under the square root, b\u00b2 - 4ac, is the discriminant (\u0394). The value of the discriminant directly affects how we proceed with the quadratic formula:\n\n1. When \u0394 > 0:\n   - The square root term \u221a\u0394 is a real number\n   - We get two distinct real solutions: x = (-b + \u221a\u0394)/(2a) and x = (-b - \u221a\u0394)/(2a)\n   - If \u0394 is a perfect square, the solutions are rational (assuming a, b, c are rational)\n   - If \u0394 is not a perfect square, the solutions are irrational\n\n2. When \u0394 = 0:\n   - The square root term \u221a\u0394 = 0\n   - The quadratic formula simplifies to x = -b/(2a)\n   - We get one repeated real solution (a double root)\n\n3. When \u0394 < 0:\n   - The square root term \u221a\u0394 involves the square root of a negative number\n   - We need to use complex numbers: \u221a\u0394 = i\u221a|\u0394| where i = \u221a(-1)\n   - We get two complex conjugate solutions: x = (-b + i\u221a|\u0394|)/(2a) and x = (-b - i\u221a|\u0394|)/(2a)\n\nUnderstanding the discriminant allows us to anticipate the nature of the solutions before carrying out the full calculation, which can save time and provide insights into the problem being solved.",
    "example": "Let's examine how the discriminant affects the solutions for three different quadratic equations:\n\n1. 2x\u00b2 - 7x + 3 = 0\n   Discriminant: \u0394 = (-7)\u00b2 - 4(2)(3) = 49 - 24 = 25\n   Since \u0394 = 25 > 0 and is a perfect square, we expect two rational solutions.\n   Using the quadratic formula: x = (7 \u00b1 \u221a25)/(2(2)) = (7 \u00b1 5)/4\n   x = 3 or x = 1/2\n\n2. x\u00b2 - 6x + 9 = 0\n   Discriminant: \u0394 = (-6)\u00b2 - 4(1)(9) = 36 - 36 = 0\n   Since \u0394 = 0, we expect one repeated solution.\n   Using the quadratic formula: x = 6/(2(1)) = 3\n   The solution is x = 3 (with multiplicity 2)\n\n3. x\u00b2 + 2x + 5 = 0\n   Discriminant: \u0394 = 2\u00b2 - 4(1)(5) = 4 - 20 = -16\n   Since \u0394 = -16 < 0, we expect two complex conjugate solutions.\n   Using the quadratic formula: x = (-2 \u00b1 \u221a(-16))/(2(1)) = (-2 \u00b1 4i)/2 = -1 \u00b1 2i\n   The solutions are x = -1 + 2i and x = -1 - 2i",
