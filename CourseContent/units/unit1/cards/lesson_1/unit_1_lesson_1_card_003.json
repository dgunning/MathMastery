    "explanation": "Every function is a relation, but not every relation is a function. Think of it this way:\n\n🔗 RELATION: Any connection between inputs and outputs\n⚙️ FUNCTION: A special relation where each input connects to exactly ONE output\n\nIt's like the difference between a messy friend and a reliable friend. A messy friend might give you different answers to the same question, but a reliable friend is consistent.",
    "example": "📱 Contact list examples:\n• Your phone number → Your name (FUNCTION - one number, one person)\n• Your birthday → People born that day (RELATION - one date, many people)\n• A person → Their parents (RELATION - one person, two parents)",
    "key_point": "Functions are reliable relations - same input always gives the same output."
