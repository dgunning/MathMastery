    "explanation": "The vertical line test is like having a superpower to instantly tell if a graph shows a function!\n\n🔍 THE TEST: Draw (or imagine) a vertical line anywhere on the graph\n✅ If the line touches the graph at ONLY ONE point → It's a function\n❌ If the line touches the graph at MORE THAN ONE point → Not a function\n\nWhy does this work? A vertical line represents the same x-value (input). If it hits the graph twice, that means one input gives two outputs - breaking the function rule!",
    "example": "🎯 Quick examples:\n• Parabola (y = x²): Passes test ✅\n• Circle: Fails test ❌ (vertical line through middle hits twice)\n• Straight line: Passes test ✅",
    "key_point": "Vertical line test checks the 'one input → one output' rule visually."
