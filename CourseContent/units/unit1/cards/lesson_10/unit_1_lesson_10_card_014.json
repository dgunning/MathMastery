    "explanation": "The solutions (or roots) of a quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0 have a direct geometric interpretation on the graph of the corresponding quadratic function f(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c.\n\nKey connections between roots and graphs:\n\n1. X-intercepts: The roots of the equation are precisely the x-coordinates where the parabola crosses the x-axis (where f(x) = 0).\n\n2. Number of roots and graph position:\n   - Two distinct real roots: The parabola crosses the x-axis at two different points\n   - One repeated real root: The parabola touches (is tangent to) the x-axis at exactly one point\n   - No real roots: The parabola doesn't intersect the x-axis at all\n\n3. Discriminant and graph:\n   - If b\u00b2 - 4ac > 0: The parabola crosses the x-axis twice\n   - If b\u00b2 - 4ac = 0: The parabola touches the x-axis once\n   - If b\u00b2 - 4ac < 0: The parabola doesn't intersect the x-axis\n\n4. Sum and product of roots:\n   - If r and s are the roots, then r + s = -b/a and r \u00d7 s = c/a\n   - The axis of symmetry of the parabola occurs at x = -b/(2a), which is the average of the roots\n   - The vertex occurs at x = -b/(2a), with y-coordinate f(-b/(2a))\n\n5. Factored form: If r and s are the roots, the quadratic can be written as f(x) = a(x - r)(x - s)",
    "example": "Consider the quadratic function f(x) = x\u00b2 - 5x + 6 and its corresponding equation x\u00b2 - 5x + 6 = 0.\n\n1. Solving the equation by factoring:\n   x\u00b2 - 5x + 6 = 0\n   (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0\n   x = 2 or x = 3\n\n2. Graphical interpretation:\n   - The parabola crosses the x-axis at x = 2 and x = 3\n   - The axis of symmetry is at x = -b/(2a) = -(-5)/(2(1)) = 5/2 = 2.5\n   - The vertex is at (2.5, f(2.5)) = (2.5, -0.25)\n   - The parabola opens upward (since a = 1 > 0)\n\n3. Using the discriminant:\n   - b\u00b2 - 4ac = (-5)\u00b2 - 4(1)(6) = 25 - 24 = 1 > 0\n   - This confirms that the equation has two distinct real roots\n\n4. The factored form of the function is:\n   f(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)\n\n5. The sum of roots is 2 + 3 = 5 = -b/a\n   The product of roots is 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 = c/a",
    "key_point": "Understanding the connection between the algebraic solutions of a quadratic equation and the geometric features of its graph provides powerful insights. This connection allows us to predict the shape and position of a parabola from its equation, and conversely, to determine properties of the equation from the graph."
