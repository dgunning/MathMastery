    "problem": "Solve the following quadratic equations that have complex roots:\n1. x\u00b2 + 4 = 0\n2. x\u00b2 + 2x + 5 = 0\n3. 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 5 = 0",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: For x\u00b2 + 4 = 0, rearrange to standard form: x\u00b2 = -4.\nUsing the square root method: x = \u00b1\u221a(-4) = \u00b12i, where i = \u221a(-1) is the imaginary unit.\nSo the solutions are x = 2i or x = -2i.",
      "Step 2: For x\u00b2 + 2x + 5 = 0, we'll use the quadratic formula with a = 1, b = 2, c = 5.\nFirst, calculate the discriminant: b\u00b2 - 4ac = 2\u00b2 - 4(1)(5) = 4 - 20 = -16\nSince the discriminant is negative, the equation has complex roots.",
      "Step 3: Substitute into the quadratic formula:\nx = (-2 \u00b1 \u221a(-16))/(2(1))\nx = (-2 \u00b1 4i)/2\nx = -1 \u00b1 2i\nSo the solutions are x = -1 + 2i or x = -1 - 2i.",
      "Step 4: For 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 5 = 0, we'll use the quadratic formula with a = 2, b = -4, c = 5.\nFirst, calculate the discriminant: b\u00b2 - 4ac = (-4)\u00b2 - 4(2)(5) = 16 - 40 = -24\nSince the discriminant is negative, the equation has complex roots.",
      "Step 5: Substitute into the quadratic formula:\nx = (-(-4) \u00b1 \u221a(-24))/(2(2))\nx = (4 \u00b1 \u221a24 \u00b7 i)/4\nx = (4 \u00b1 2\u221a6 \u00b7 i)/4\nx = 1 \u00b1 (\u221a6/2)i\nSo the solutions are x = 1 + (\u221a6/2)i or x = 1 - (\u221a6/2)i."
    ],
    "explanation": "When a quadratic equation has a negative discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac < 0), it has no real solutions. Instead, it has two complex conjugate solutions of the form \u03b1 \u00b1 \u03b2i, where:\n\n- \u03b1 = -b/(2a) is the real part\n- \u03b2 = \u221a|b\u00b2 - 4ac|/(2a) is the coefficient of the imaginary part\n- i = \u221a(-1) is the imaginary unit\n\nComplex roots always come in conjugate pairs (if \u03b1 + \u03b2i is a root, then \u03b1 - \u03b2i is also a root).\n\nAlthough complex roots don't have a direct geometric interpretation on the real number line, they are important in mathematics and have applications in physics, engineering, and other fields. On the graph of a quadratic function, complex roots indicate that the parabola does not intersect the x-axis."
