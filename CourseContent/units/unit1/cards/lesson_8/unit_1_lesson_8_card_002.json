    "problem": "Complete the square for the expression x\u00b2 + 8x.",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: Identify the coefficient of x, which is 8",
      "Step 2: Take half of this coefficient: 8 \u00f7 2 = 4",
      "Step 3: Square this value: 4\u00b2 = 16",
      "Step 4: Add and subtract this value to maintain equality\nx\u00b2 + 8x = x\u00b2 + 8x + 16 - 16",
      "Step 5: Rewrite the first three terms as a perfect square trinomial\nx\u00b2 + 8x + 16 - 16 = (x + 4)\u00b2 - 16",
      "Step 6: Verify by expanding\n(x + 4)\u00b2 - 16 = x\u00b2 + 8x + 16 - 16 = x\u00b2 + 8x \u2713"
    ],
    "explanation": "Completing the square involves adding the square of half the coefficient of x to create a perfect square trinomial. To maintain the equality, we must also subtract the same value. This technique allows us to rewrite quadratic expressions in a form that's easier to analyze."
