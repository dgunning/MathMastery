    "problem": "Solve the quadratic equation x\u00b2 - 6x + 5 = 0 by completing the square.",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: Rearrange the equation to get zero on one side (already done)",
      "Step 2: Complete the square for the left side\nFor x\u00b2 - 6x, take half of -6, which is -3, and square it: (-3)\u00b2 = 9\nx\u00b2 - 6x + 5 = 0\nx\u00b2 - 6x + 9 - 9 + 5 = 0\n(x - 3)\u00b2 - 9 + 5 = 0\n(x - 3)\u00b2 - 4 = 0",
      "Step 3: Isolate the squared term\n(x - 3)\u00b2 = 4",
      "Step 4: Take the square root of both sides\n\u221a(x - 3)\u00b2 = \u00b1\u221a4\nx - 3 = \u00b12",
      "Step 5: Solve for x\nx - 3 = 2 or x - 3 = -2\nx = 5 or x = 1",
      "Step 6: Verify the solutions\nFor x = 5: 5\u00b2 - 6(5) + 5 = 25 - 30 + 5 = 0 \u2713\nFor x = 1: 1\u00b2 - 6(1) + 5 = 1 - 6 + 5 = 0 \u2713"
    ],
    "explanation": "Completing the square is a powerful method for solving quadratic equations, especially when the quadratic expression cannot be easily factored. By converting to the form (x - h)\u00b2 = r, we can use the square root property to find the solutions."
