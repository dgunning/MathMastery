    "explanation": "The quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac))/(2a) can actually be derived using the completing the square method. Understanding this connection helps us see why the formula works.\n\nStarting with the standard form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, we can apply completing the square to derive the quadratic formula:\n\n1. Divide all terms by a: x\u00b2 + (b/a)x + (c/a) = 0\n2. Move the constant term: x\u00b2 + (b/a)x = -(c/a)\n3. Complete the square: (x + (b/2a))\u00b2 - (b/2a)\u00b2 = -(c/a)\n4. Simplify: (x + (b/2a))\u00b2 = (b\u00b2/4a\u00b2) - (c/a)\n5. Combine fractions: (x + (b/2a))\u00b2 = (b\u00b2 - 4ac)/(4a\u00b2)\n6. Take the square root: x + (b/2a) = \u00b1\u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)/(2a)\n7. Solve for x: x = -b/(2a) \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)/(2a)\n8. Factor: x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac))/(2a)",
    "example": "For the equation 2x\u00b2 - 6x + 3 = 0:\n\nUsing the quadratic formula with a = 2, b = -6, c = 3:\nx = (-(-6) \u00b1 \u221a((-6)\u00b2 - 4(2)(3)))/(2(2))\nx = (6 \u00b1 \u221a(36 - 24))/4\nx = (6 \u00b1 \u221a12)/4\nx = (6 \u00b1 2\u221a3)/4\nx = 3/2 \u00b1 \u221a3/2",
    "key_point": "Completing the square is not just a technique for solving specific quadratic equations\u2014it's the foundation for the general quadratic formula that works for all quadratic equations."
