    "problem": "Convert f(x) = x\u00b2 + 4x - 12 to vertex form by completing the square, and then use the vertex form to sketch the graph.",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: Complete the square to find the vertex form\nf(x) = x\u00b2 + 4x - 12\nf(x) = (x\u00b2 + 4x) - 12\nf(x) = (x\u00b2 + 4x + 4 - 4) - 12\nf(x) = (x + 2)\u00b2 - 4 - 12\nf(x) = (x + 2)\u00b2 - 16",
      "Step 2: Identify the vertex from the vertex form\nComparing with f(x) = a(x - h)\u00b2 + k, we have a = 1, h = -2, k = -16\nSo the vertex is (-2, -16)",
      "Step 3: Determine the direction of opening\nSince a = 1 > 0, the parabola opens upward\nThis means the vertex is a minimum point",
      "Step 4: Find additional points by substituting values\nLet's try x = -1 and x = -3 (one unit away from the vertex in each direction)\nf(-1) = (-1 + 2)\u00b2 - 16 = 1\u00b2 - 16 = -15\nf(-3) = (-3 + 2)\u00b2 - 16 = (-1)\u00b2 - 16 = -15",
      "Step 5: Find the y-intercept by evaluating f(0)\nf(0) = (0 + 2)\u00b2 - 16 = 4 - 16 = -12",
      "Step 6: Find the x-intercepts by solving f(x) = 0\n(x + 2)\u00b2 - 16 = 0\n(x + 2)\u00b2 = 16\nx + 2 = \u00b14\nx = -2 \u00b1 4\nx = 2 or x = -6",
      "Step 7: Plot the points (-6, 0), (-3, -15), (-2, -16), (-1, -15), (0, -12), and (2, 0), and connect them with a smooth parabola"
    ],
    "explanation": "Converting a quadratic function to vertex form through completing the square makes graphing much easier. The vertex form immediately gives us the vertex, which is the key point of the parabola. From there, we can find additional points to complete the graph."
