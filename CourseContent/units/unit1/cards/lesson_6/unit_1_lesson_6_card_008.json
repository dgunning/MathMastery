    "problem": "A company sells x items at a price of p = 100 - 0.5x dollars per item. The revenue R is given by R(x) = x\u00b7p = x(100 - 0.5x) = 100x - 0.5x\u00b2. How many items should the company sell to maximize revenue, and what is the maximum revenue?",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: Expand the revenue function\nR(x) = 100x - 0.5x\u00b2\nThis is a quadratic function with a = -0.5, b = 100, c = 0",
      "Step 2: Find the x-coordinate of the vertex using x = -b/(2a)\nx = -(100)/(2(-0.5)) = 100/1 = 100 items",
      "Step 3: Calculate the maximum revenue by evaluating R(100)\nR(100) = 100(100) - 0.5(100)\u00b2\nR(100) = 10,000 - 0.5(10,000)\nR(100) = 10,000 - 5,000\nR(100) = $5,000",
      "Step 4: State the answer\nThe company should sell 100 items to maximize revenue, and the maximum revenue is $5,000"
    ],
    "explanation": "In economics, quadratic functions often model revenue or profit. The vertex represents the optimal number of items to produce/sell to maximize the outcome. This is a practical application of finding the vertex of a parabola."
