    "explanation": "The vertex of a quadratic function is closely related to the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) and the nature of its roots.\n\nFor a quadratic function f(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c with vertex (h, k):\n\n- If k and a have opposite signs (k < 0 when a > 0, or k > 0 when a < 0), the function has two real roots\n- If k = 0, the function has a repeated root at x = h\n- If k and a have the same sign (k > 0 when a > 0, or k < 0 when a < 0), the function has no real roots\n\nThis corresponds to whether the discriminant is positive, zero, or negative.",
    "example": "For f(x) = 2x\u00b2 - 8x + 7, the vertex is at (2, -1).\nSince k = -1 < 0 and a = 2 > 0 (opposite signs), the function has two real roots.\n\nIndeed, the discriminant is b\u00b2 - 4ac = (-8)\u00b2 - 4(2)(7) = 64 - 56 = 8 > 0, confirming two real roots.",
    "key_point": "The position of the vertex relative to the x-axis (determined by the sign of k) combined with the direction of opening (determined by the sign of a) tells us whether a quadratic function crosses the x-axis 0, 1, or 2 times."
