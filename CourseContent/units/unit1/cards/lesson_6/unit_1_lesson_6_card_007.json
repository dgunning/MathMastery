    "problem": "A ball is thrown upward from a height of 6 feet with an initial velocity of 32 feet per second. The height h(t) of the ball after t seconds is given by h(t) = -16t\u00b2 + 32t + 6. Find the maximum height reached by the ball and the time at which it occurs.",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: Identify that this is a quadratic function with a < 0, so it has a maximum value at the vertex\nh(t) = -16t\u00b2 + 32t + 6, where a = -16, b = 32, c = 6",
      "Step 2: Find the t-coordinate of the vertex using t = -b/(2a)\nt = -(32)/(2(-16)) = 32/32 = 1 second",
      "Step 3: Find the maximum height by evaluating h(1)\nh(1) = -16(1)\u00b2 + 32(1) + 6\nh(1) = -16 + 32 + 6\nh(1) = 22 feet",
      "Step 4: State the answer\nThe ball reaches its maximum height of 22 feet after 1 second"
    ],
    "explanation": "In physics, quadratic functions often model the height of projectiles under gravity. The vertex represents the maximum height and the time at which it occurs. The negative coefficient of t\u00b2 reflects the downward force of gravity."
