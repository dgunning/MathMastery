    "problem": "A company wants to create an open-top box from a 16 cm \u00d7 16 cm square piece of cardboard by cutting equal-sized squares from each corner and folding up the sides. What size squares should be cut from the corners to maximize the volume of the box?",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: Define variables and write equations\nLet x = side length of the square cut from each corner (in cm)\nThe base of the box will be (16 - 2x) \u00d7 (16 - 2x)\nThe height of the box will be x",
      "Step 2: Write the volume as a function of x\nVolume = length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height\nV(x) = (16 - 2x)(16 - 2x)(x)\nV(x) = (16 - 2x)\u00b2(x)\nV(x) = (256 - 64x + 4x\u00b2)(x)\nV(x) = 256x - 64x\u00b2 + 4x\u00b3",
      "Step 3: Find the critical points by taking the derivative (we'll use a shortcut)\nFor a cubic function like this, we need to find where the derivative equals zero\nThe derivative of V(x) is V'(x) = 256 - 128x + 12x\u00b2\nSetting V'(x) = 0: 256 - 128x + 12x\u00b2 = 0\nSolving this quadratic equation gives x \u2248 2.67 or x \u2248 8\nSince x = 8 would make the box dimensions negative, x \u2248 2.67 is our only valid critical point",
      "Step 4: Verify this is a maximum by checking the second derivative or by testing nearby values\nTesting confirms that x \u2248 2.67 gives a maximum volume",
      "Step 5: Calculate the maximum volume\nV(2.67) = 256(2.67) - 64(2.67)\u00b2 + 4(2.67)\u00b3 \u2248 683.43 - 456.53 + 76.10 \u2248 303 cubic cm",
      "Step 6: State the answer\nSquares of approximately 2.67 cm should be cut from each corner to maximize the volume at about 303 cubic cm"
    ],
    "explanation": "This problem involves maximizing a cubic function, which is slightly more complex than a quadratic. However, the principle is the same: we find the critical points where the derivative equals zero, then determine which critical point gives the maximum value."
