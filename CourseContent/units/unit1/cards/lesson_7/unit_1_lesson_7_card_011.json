    "explanation": "The range of a quadratic function is directly related to its maximum or minimum value.\n\nFor a quadratic function f(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c with maximum or minimum value k:\n\n- If a > 0 (opens upward), the range is [k, \u221e), meaning the function takes on all values greater than or equal to k\n- If a < 0 (opens downward), the range is (-\u221e, k], meaning the function takes on all values less than or equal to k\n\nThe maximum or minimum value serves as the boundary of the range.",
    "example": "For f(x) = 3x\u00b2 - 12x + 14:\n- Since a = 3 > 0, the parabola opens upward and has a minimum value\n- The minimum value occurs at x = -b/(2a) = -(-12)/(2(3)) = 12/6 = 2\n- The minimum value is f(2) = 3(2)\u00b2 - 12(2) + 14 = 12 - 24 + 14 = 2\n- Therefore, the range of f(x) is [2, \u221e)",
    "key_point": "Finding the maximum or minimum value of a quadratic function allows us to determine its range, which is an important characteristic of the function."
