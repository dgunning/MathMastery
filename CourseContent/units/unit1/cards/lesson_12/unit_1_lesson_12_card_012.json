    "explanation": "Finding quadratic equations from given information about their roots or other properties has many practical applications in real-world scenarios. These applications span various fields including physics, engineering, economics, and design.\n\nHere are some important real-world applications:\n\n1. Projectile Motion\n   - The height h(t) of a projectile can be modeled by a quadratic function of time\n   - If we know when the object hits the ground (the roots of the equation), we can determine the complete trajectory\n   - Example: A ball thrown from a cliff returns to ground level after 2 seconds and 5 seconds. We can find the quadratic equation h(t) that models its height\n\n2. Revenue and Profit Modeling\n   - Revenue and profit functions in economics are often quadratic\n   - Break-even points (where profit = 0) are the roots of the profit function\n   - Example: A company breaks even at production levels of 10 and 50 units. We can find the profit function\n\n3. Structural Design\n   - The shape of cables in suspension bridges follows a parabolic curve\n   - Knowing the points where the cable meets the supports (roots) helps determine the equation of the curve\n   - Example: A cable is attached at points 30m apart and reaches a maximum sag of 5m at the center\n\n4. Optimization Problems\n   - Many optimization problems involve finding the maximum or minimum value of a quadratic function\n   - Knowing the zeros of the derivative (which is a linear function) helps determine the original quadratic function\n   - Example: A rectangular field with a perimeter of 100m needs to maximize area\n\n5. Data Analysis and Curve Fitting\n   - When data points suggest a parabolic relationship, we can fit a quadratic function\n   - Knowing specific points or properties helps determine the equation\n   - Example: Temperature readings throughout a day often follow a quadratic pattern",
    "example": "A ball is thrown upward from a 20-meter cliff. It hits the ground below the cliff after 3 seconds and 7 seconds. Find the quadratic equation that models the height of the ball as a function of time.\n\nStep 1: Let h(t) = at\u00b2 + bt + c represent the height of the ball at time t.\n\nStep 2: We know that h(3) = 0 and h(7) = 0, since these are the times when the ball hits the ground (height = 0).\n\nStep 3: Using the factored form, we can write h(t) = a(t - 3)(t - 7), where a is a constant to be determined.\n\nStep 4: Expand this expression: h(t) = a(t\u00b2 - 7t - 3t + 21) = a(t\u00b2 - 10t + 21).\n\nStep 5: We also know that at t = 0, the ball is at the top of the 20-meter cliff, so h(0) = 20.\n\nStep 6: Substitute t = 0 into our equation: 20 = a(0\u00b2 - 10(0) + 21) = 21a.\n\nStep 7: Solve for a: a = 20/21.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the height function is h(t) = (20/21)(t\u00b2 - 10t + 21).\n\nStep 9: Simplify: h(t) = (20/21)t\u00b2 - (200/21)t + 20.\n\nThis quadratic function models the height of the ball at any time t. We can verify that h(3) = 0 and h(7) = 0, and h(0) = 20, as required.",
    "key_point": "When applying the concept of finding quadratic equations from roots to real-world problems:\n\n1. Identify what the roots represent in the context of the problem (e.g., times when height = 0, break-even points, etc.)\n\n2. Determine what additional information is available (initial conditions, maximum/minimum values, etc.)\n\n3. Set up the quadratic equation using either:\n   - The factored form: f(x) = a(x - r\u2081)(x - r\u2082)\n   - Vieta's formulas and the standard form: f(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c\n\n4. Use the additional information to find any unknown coefficients\n\n5. Interpret the resulting equation in the context of the original problem\n\nThis process allows us to create mathematical models that accurately represent real-world phenomena and make predictions based on these models."
