  "duration": 120,
  "content": {
    "problem": "Find the quadratic function f(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c based on the following graphical information:\n\n1. A parabola with x-intercepts at -2 and 3, and y-intercept at -6\n2. A parabola with vertex at (1, -4) and passing through the point (3, 0)\n3. A parabola with x-intercepts at 2 and 2 (repeated root), and passing through the point (0, 4)",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: For problem 1, the x-intercepts are at x = -2 and x = 3, which means these are the roots of the quadratic function.",
      "Step 2: We can write the function in factored form as f(x) = a(x - (-2))(x - 3) = a(x + 2)(x - 3).",
      "Step 3: Expand this expression: f(x) = a(x\u00b2 - 3x + 2x - 6) = a(x\u00b2 - x - 6).",
      "Step 4: We're also given that the y-intercept is -6, which means f(0) = -6.",
      "Step 5: Substitute x = 0 into our expression: f(0) = a(0\u00b2 - 0 - 6) = -6a = -6.",
      "Step 6: Solving for a: a = 1.",
      "Step 7: Therefore, the quadratic function is f(x) = x\u00b2 - x - 6.",
      "Step 8: For problem 2, the vertex is at (1, -4), so we can write the function in vertex form: f(x) = a(x - 1)\u00b2 - 4.",
      "Step 9: We're also given that the parabola passes through the point (3, 0), so f(3) = 0.",
      "Step 10: Substitute x = 3 into our expression: 0 = a(3 - 1)\u00b2 - 4 = 4a - 4.",
      "Step 11: Solving for a: 4a = 4, so a = 1.",
      "Step 12: Therefore, the quadratic function is f(x) = (x - 1)\u00b2 - 4 = x\u00b2 - 2x + 1 - 4 = x\u00b2 - 2x - 3.",
      "Step 13: For problem 3, the x-intercept at x = 2 is a repeated root, which means the function can be written as f(x) = a(x - 2)\u00b2.",
      "Step 14: We're also given that the parabola passes through the point (0, 4), so f(0) = 4.",
      "Step 15: Substitute x = 0 into our expression: 4 = a(0 - 2)\u00b2 = 4a.",
      "Step 16: Solving for a: a = 1.",
      "Step 17: Therefore, the quadratic function is f(x) = (x - 2)\u00b2 = x\u00b2 - 4x + 4."

    "explanation": "When finding a quadratic equation from graphical information, we use different approaches depending on what information is provided:\n\n1. From x-intercepts (roots):\n   - If we know the roots r and s, we can write f(x) = a(x - r)(x - s)\n   - We need one additional piece of information (like a y-intercept or another point) to find a\n\n2. From the vertex and a point:\n   - If we know the vertex (h, k), we can write f(x) = a(x - h)\u00b2 + k\n   - We need one additional point to find a\n\n3. From a repeated root and a point:\n   - If we know a repeated root r, we can write f(x) = a(x - r)\u00b2\n   - We need one additional point to find a\n\nKey graphical features and their mathematical significance:\n\n- x-intercepts: These are the roots of the equation f(x) = 0\n- y-intercept: This is the value of f(0)\n- Vertex: This is the maximum or minimum point of the parabola at x = -b/(2a)\n\nBy identifying these key features from a graph, we can determine the equation of the quadratic function without having to solve a system of equations."
