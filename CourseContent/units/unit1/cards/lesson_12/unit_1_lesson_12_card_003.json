  "content": {
    "problem": "Find the quadratic equation in standard form (ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0) with the given complex roots:\n\n1. Roots: 2 + 3i and 2 - 3i, with a = 1\n2. Roots: -1 + i and -1 - i, with a = 2\n3. Roots: 4 + 5i and 4 - 5i, with a = 3",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: For a quadratic equation with roots r and s, we can write it in factored form as a(x - r)(x - s) = 0. When the roots are complex conjugates, the resulting equation will have real coefficients.",
      "Step 2: For problem 1, with roots 2 + 3i and 2 - 3i and a = 1, the factored form is (x - (2 + 3i))(x - (2 - 3i)) = 0.",
      "Step 3: Let's expand this expression: (x - (2 + 3i))(x - (2 - 3i)) = (x - 2 - 3i)(x - 2 + 3i).",
      "Step 4: Multiply these binomials: (x - 2 - 3i)(x - 2 + 3i) = (x - 2)\u00b2 - (3i)\u00b2.",
      "Step 5: Simplify: (x - 2)\u00b2 - (3i)\u00b2 = (x - 2)\u00b2 - (3)\u00b2(-1) = (x - 2)\u00b2 + 9 = x\u00b2 - 4x + 4 + 9 = x\u00b2 - 4x + 13.",
      "Step 6: Therefore, the quadratic equation is x\u00b2 - 4x + 13 = 0.",
      "Step 7: For problem 2, with roots -1 + i and -1 - i and a = 2, the factored form is 2(x - (-1 + i))(x - (-1 - i)) = 2(x + 1 - i)(x + 1 + i).",
      "Step 8: Using the same pattern as before: 2(x + 1 - i)(x + 1 + i) = 2((x + 1)\u00b2 - i\u00b2) = 2((x + 1)\u00b2 + 1) = 2(x\u00b2 + 2x + 1 + 1) = 2(x\u00b2 + 2x + 2).",
      "Step 9: Therefore, the quadratic equation is 2x\u00b2 + 4x + 4 = 0, which can be simplified to x\u00b2 + 2x + 2 = 0.",
      "Step 10: For problem 3, with roots 4 + 5i and 4 - 5i and a = 3, the factored form is 3(x - (4 + 5i))(x - (4 - 5i)) = 3(x - 4 - 5i)(x - 4 + 5i).",
      "Step 11: Expand: 3(x - 4 - 5i)(x - 4 + 5i) = 3((x - 4)\u00b2 - (5i)\u00b2) = 3((x - 4)\u00b2 + 25) = 3(x\u00b2 - 8x + 16 + 25) = 3(x\u00b2 - 8x + 41).",
      "Step 12: Therefore, the quadratic equation is 3x\u00b2 - 24x + 123 = 0."

    "explanation": "When finding a quadratic equation from complex roots, there are a few important principles to remember:\n\n1. Complex roots always come in conjugate pairs (a + bi and a - bi) for quadratic equations with real coefficients.\n\n2. The product of complex conjugates (a + bi)(a - bi) follows a special pattern:\n   (a + bi)(a - bi) = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2\n   This is because (a + bi)(a - bi) = a\u00b2 - (bi)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2(-1) = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2\n\n3. When expanding (x - (a + bi))(x - (a - bi)), we get:\n   (x - a - bi)(x - a + bi) = (x - a)\u00b2 - (bi)\u00b2 = (x - a)\u00b2 + b\u00b2\n\n4. The resulting quadratic equation will always have real coefficients, even though the roots are complex.\n\n5. We can verify our work by checking that the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative, which confirms that the equation has complex roots.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the relationships between coefficients and roots:\n- If the roots are a + bi and a - bi, then their sum is 2a and their product is a\u00b2 + b\u00b2\n- For a quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0:\n  - b = -a(sum of roots) = -2aa\n  - c = a(product of roots) = a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)"
