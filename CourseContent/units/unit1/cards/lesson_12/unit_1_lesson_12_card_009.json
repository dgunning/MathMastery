    "problem": "Find the quadratic function f(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c that satisfies the given conditions:\n\n1. Vertex: (2, -3), root: 4\n2. Vertex: (-1, 5), root: 2\n3. Vertex: (3, 0), root: 5",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: When given the vertex (h, k) of a quadratic function, we can write the function in vertex form: f(x) = a(x - h)\u00b2 + k.",
      "Step 2: For problem 1, with vertex (2, -3) and root 4, we start with f(x) = a(x - 2)\u00b2 - 3.",
      "Step 3: Since 4 is a root, f(4) = 0. Substituting: 0 = a(4 - 2)\u00b2 - 3 = a(4) - 3.",
      "Step 4: Solving for a: a(4) = 3, so a = 3/4.",
      "Step 5: Therefore, the quadratic function is f(x) = (3/4)(x - 2)\u00b2 - 3.",
      "Step 6: We can convert this to standard form: f(x) = (3/4)x\u00b2 - 3x + 3 - 3 = (3/4)x\u00b2 - 3x.",
      "Step 7: For problem 2, with vertex (-1, 5) and root 2, we start with f(x) = a(x - (-1))\u00b2 + 5 = a(x + 1)\u00b2 + 5.",
      "Step 8: Since 2 is a root, f(2) = 0. Substituting: 0 = a(2 + 1)\u00b2 + 5 = a(9) + 5.",
      "Step 9: Solving for a: a(9) = -5, so a = -5/9.",
      "Step 10: Therefore, the quadratic function is f(x) = (-5/9)(x + 1)\u00b2 + 5.",
      "Step 11: We can convert this to standard form: f(x) = (-5/9)x\u00b2 - (10/9)x - 5/9 + 5 = (-5/9)x\u00b2 - (10/9)x + 40/9.",
      "Step 12: For problem 3, with vertex (3, 0) and root 5, we start with f(x) = a(x - 3)\u00b2.",
      "Step 13: Since 5 is a root, f(5) = 0. Substituting: 0 = a(5 - 3)\u00b2 = a(4).",
      "Step 14: This equation is satisfied when a = 0, which would make f(x) = 0 for all x. However, this isn't a proper quadratic function. This suggests there's an error in the given conditions, as a parabola with vertex (3, 0) already has 3 as a root, so it can't have another root unless it's the zero function.",
      "Step 15: If we assume the vertex is (3, 0) and the parabola is not the zero function, then 3 must be the only root (a repeated root), and the function would be f(x) = a(x - 3)\u00b2 for any non-zero value of a."
    ],
    "explanation": "When finding a quadratic function with a given vertex and root, we use the vertex form of the quadratic function:\n\nf(x) = a(x - h)\u00b2 + k\n\nWhere (h, k) is the vertex and a is a constant that determines the opening direction and steepness of the parabola.\n\nThe process involves these steps:\n\n1. Substitute the vertex coordinates into the vertex form\n\n2. Use the given root r to set up the equation f(r) = 0:\n   a(r - h)\u00b2 + k = 0\n\n3. Solve for the value of a:\n   a = -k/((r - h)\u00b2)\n\n4. Substitute the value of a back into the vertex form\n\n5. If needed, convert to standard form using these relationships:\n   f(x) = a(x - h)\u00b2 + k = ax\u00b2 - 2ahx + ah\u00b2 + k\n   So, a = a, b = -2ah, and c = ah\u00b2 + k\n\nSpecial cases to note:\n\n- If the vertex (h, k) is on the x-axis (k = 0), then h is already a root of the function\n\n- If the given root is the same as the x-coordinate of the vertex, then the vertex is on the x-axis and the root is a repeated root\n\n- If the conditions are inconsistent (as in problem 3), there may be an error in the given information or the function might be degenerate"
