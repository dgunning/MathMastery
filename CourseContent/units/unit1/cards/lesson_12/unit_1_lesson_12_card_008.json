    "problem": "Find the quadratic function f(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c that satisfies the given conditions:\n\n1. Roots: 3 and -2, passes through the point (1, 5)\n2. Roots: 4 and 4, passes through the point (2, -8)\n3. Roots: 1 + i and 1 - i, passes through the point (2, 3)",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: For problem 1, since the roots are 3 and -2, we can write the function in factored form as f(x) = a(x - 3)(x - (-2)) = a(x - 3)(x + 2).",
      "Step 2: Expand this expression: f(x) = a(x\u00b2 + 2x - 3x - 6) = a(x\u00b2 - x - 6).",
      "Step 3: Use the condition that f(1) = 5: 5 = a(1\u00b2 - 1 - 6) = a(-6), which gives us a = -5/6.",
      "Step 4: Therefore, the quadratic function is f(x) = (-5/6)(x\u00b2 - x - 6) = (-5/6)x\u00b2 + (5/6)x + 5.",
      "Step 5: For problem 2, since the roots are both 4 (a repeated root), we can write the function in factored form as f(x) = a(x - 4)\u00b2.",
      "Step 6: Use the condition that f(2) = -8: -8 = a(2 - 4)\u00b2 = a(4), which gives us a = -2.",
      "Step 7: Therefore, the quadratic function is f(x) = -2(x - 4)\u00b2 = -2x\u00b2 + 16x - 32.",
      "Step 8: For problem 3, since the roots are 1 + i and 1 - i, we can write the function in factored form as f(x) = a(x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).",
      "Step 9: Expand this expression: f(x) = a((x - 1) - i)((x - 1) + i) = a((x - 1)\u00b2 - i\u00b2) = a((x - 1)\u00b2 + 1) = a(x\u00b2 - 2x + 1 + 1) = a(x\u00b2 - 2x + 2).",
      "Step 10: Use the condition that f(2) = 3: 3 = a(2\u00b2 - 2(2) + 2) = a(4 - 4 + 2) = a(2), which gives us a = 3/2.",
      "Step 11: Therefore, the quadratic function is f(x) = (3/2)(x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) = (3/2)x\u00b2 - 3x + 3."

    "explanation": "When finding a quadratic function that has specific roots and passes through a given point, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Use the roots to write the function in factored form: f(x) = a(x - r\u2081)(x - r\u2082)\n   - If the roots are complex conjugates r = p \u00b1 qi, use f(x) = a((x - p)\u00b2 + q\u00b2)\n   - If there's a repeated root r, use f(x) = a(x - r)\u00b2\n\n2. Expand the factored form to get f(x) = a(x\u00b2 + bx + c)\n\n3. Use the given point (x\u2080, y\u2080) to find the value of a:\n   y\u2080 = a(x\u2080\u00b2 + bx\u2080 + c)\n   a = y\u2080/(x\u2080\u00b2 + bx\u2080 + c)\n\n4. Substitute the value of a back into the expanded form to get the final function\n\nThis method works because:\n- The factored form guarantees that the function has the required roots\n- The scaling factor a is determined by the additional point constraint\n- The resulting function is unique (there is exactly one quadratic function with given roots and passing through a specific point)\n\nWhen working with complex roots, remember that a quadratic function with real coefficients will always have complex roots in conjugate pairs (p + qi and p - qi)."
