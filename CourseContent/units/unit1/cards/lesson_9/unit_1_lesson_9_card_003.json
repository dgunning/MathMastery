    "explanation": "To simplify a radical expression, we look for factors of the radicand that are perfect powers matching the index of the radical. For square roots, we look for perfect square factors. For cube roots, we look for perfect cube factors.\n\nThe goal is to extract as many factors as possible from under the radical sign. A radical is considered simplified when:\n1. The radicand has no factor that is a perfect power matching the index\n2. There are no fractions under the radical sign\n3. There are no radicals in the denominator"
