      "Step 1: For \u221a6 \u00d7 \u221a10, use the product property of radicals in reverse.\n\u221a6 \u00d7 \u221a10 = \u221a(6 \u00d7 10) = \u221a60",
      "Step 2: Simplify the result if possible.\n\u221a60 = \u221a(4 \u00d7 15) = \u221a4 \u00d7 \u221a15 = 2\u221a15",

    "explanation": "When multiplying radical expressions with the same index, we can use the product property of radicals: \u207f\u221aa \u00d7 \u207f\u221ab = \u207f\u221a(a \u00d7 b).\n\nThe general steps for multiplying radicals are:\n1. Multiply the coefficients outside the radicals\n2. Use the product property to combine the radicands\n3. Simplify the resulting radical expression if possible\n\nFor expressions with variables, remember to account for the exponents when simplifying."
