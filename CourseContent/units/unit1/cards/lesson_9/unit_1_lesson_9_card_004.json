    "explanation": "When simplifying radicals with variables, we apply the same principles as with numbers, but we need to pay attention to the exponents of each variable.\n\nFor square roots (index 2):\n- Variables with even exponents can be simplified (e.g., \u221a(x\u2076) = x\u00b3)\n- Variables with odd exponents leave a remainder (e.g., \u221a(x\u2075) = x\u00b2 \u00d7 \u221ax)\n\nFor cube roots (index 3):\n- Variables with exponents divisible by 3 can be simplified (e.g., \u00b3\u221a(x\u2076) = x\u00b2)\n- Variables with other exponents leave a remainder (e.g., \u00b3\u221a(x\u2075) = x\u00b9 \u00d7 \u00b3\u221a(x\u00b2))\n\nIn general, for a radical with index n, we divide the exponent by n and extract the quotient, leaving the remainder under the radical."
