    "problem": "Graph the following radical functions and state their domains:\n1. f(x) = \u221ax\n2. g(x) = \u221a(x - 2) + 1",

      "Step 1: For f(x) = \u221ax, determine the domain.\nSince we can only take the square root of non-negative numbers, the domain is x \u2265 0.",

      "Step 4: For g(x) = \u221a(x - 2) + 1, determine the domain.\nWe need x - 2 \u2265 0, which means x \u2265 2. So the domain is x \u2265 2.",

    "explanation": "When graphing radical functions, there are several key considerations:\n\n1. Domain: Determine where the function is defined. For square root functions, the expression inside the radical must be non-negative.\n\n2. Transformations: Identify how the basic radical function is transformed:\n   - Horizontal shifts: f(x) = \u221a(x - h) shifts the graph h units right\n   - Vertical shifts: f(x) = \u221ax + k shifts the graph k units up\n   - Reflections: f(x) = -\u221ax reflects the graph across the x-axis\n   - Stretches/compressions: f(x) = a\u221ax stretches or compresses the graph vertically\n\n3. Key points: The y-intercept (if in the domain) and any points where the function equals zero are helpful for sketching the graph.\n\n4. Shape: Square root functions have a characteristic shape that starts at the origin (or the minimum x-value in the domain) and increases at a decreasing rate."
