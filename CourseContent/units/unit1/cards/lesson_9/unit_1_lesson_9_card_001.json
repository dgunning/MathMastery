    "explanation": "A radical expression is a mathematical expression that contains a radical symbol (\u221a). The radical symbol represents the operation of taking a root of a number or expression.\n\nThe most common radical is the square root (\u221a), which gives a value that, when multiplied by itself, equals the number under the radical. For example, \u221a9 = 3 because 3\u00b2 = 9.\n\nThe general form of a radical is \u207f\u221ax, where:\n- n is the index (or order) of the radical\n- x is the radicand (the expression under the radical symbol)\n\nWhen n = 2 (square root), the index is typically omitted: \u221ax instead of \u00b2\u221ax.\n\nOther common radicals include:\n- Cube root: \u00b3\u221ax (the value that, when cubed, equals x)\n- Fourth root: \u2074\u221ax (the value that, when raised to the fourth power, equals x)",
    "example": "Examples of radical expressions:\n\n1. \u221a16 = 4 (because 4\u00b2 = 16)\n2. \u00b3\u221a27 = 3 (because 3\u00b3 = 27)\n3. \u2074\u221a16 = 2 (because 2\u2074 = 16)\n4. \u221ax\u00b2 + 9 (a radical expression with a variable)\n\nRadicals can also be expressed using fractional exponents:\n- \u221ax = x^(1/2)\n- \u00b3\u221ax = x^(1/3)\n- \u207f\u221ax = x^(1/n)",
    "key_point": "Radicals are the inverse operations of exponents. Just as exponents represent repeated multiplication, radicals represent finding what value, when raised to a power, gives the radicand."
