    "steps": [
      "Step 1: For 4/\u221a3, multiply both numerator and denominator by \u221a3 to rationalize the denominator.\n4/\u221a3 = (4 \u00d7 \u221a3)/(\u221a3 \u00d7 \u221a3) = 4\u221a3/3",
      "Step 2: For \u221a8/\u221a6, first use the quotient property of radicals.\n\u221a8/\u221a6 = \u221a(8/6) = \u221a(4/3) = \u221a4/\u221a3 = 2/\u221a3",
      "Step 3: Now rationalize the denominator as in Step 1.\n2/\u221a3 = (2 \u00d7 \u221a3)/(\u221a3 \u00d7 \u221a3) = 2\u221a3/3",
      "Step 4: For 5/(2 + \u221a5), multiply both numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator (2 - \u221a5).\n5/(2 + \u221a5) = 5(2 - \u221a5)/((2 + \u221a5)(2 - \u221a5))",
      "Step 5: Expand the denominator using the difference of squares formula: (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2.\n(2 + \u221a5)(2 - \u221a5) = 2\u00b2 - (\u221a5)\u00b2 = 4 - 5 = -1",
      "Step 6: Expand the numerator and simplify.\n5(2 - \u221a5)/(-1) = (10 - 5\u221a5)/(-1) = -10 + 5\u221a5"

    "explanation": "Rationalizing the denominator is a technique used to eliminate radicals from the denominator of a fraction. This is done for two main reasons:\n\n1. Historically, it was easier to calculate decimal approximations without radicals in the denominator\n2. It's a standard form that makes expressions easier to compare and work with\n\nThe process involves multiplying both the numerator and denominator by an appropriate expression:\n\n- For a single radical (like \u221aa), multiply by that same radical\n- For a binomial involving a radical (like a + \u221ab), multiply by its conjugate (a - \u221ab)\n\nThe key is that whatever we multiply the denominator by, we must also multiply the numerator by to maintain equality."
