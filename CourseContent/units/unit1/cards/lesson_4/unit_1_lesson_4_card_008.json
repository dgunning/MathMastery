    "explanation": "Functions are all around us in everyday life. They model relationships between quantities in the real world.\n\nFor example:\n- The cost of a cab ride as a function of distance traveled\n- The height of a thrown ball as a function of time\n- The temperature of a cup of coffee as a function of time since brewing\n\nIn each case, one quantity (the output) depends on another quantity (the input) in a predictable way.",
    "example": "The function C(g) = 3.79g represents the cost C in dollars to buy g gallons of gasoline at $3.79 per gallon.\n\nDomain: g \u2265 0 (you can't buy a negative amount of gas)\nRange: C \u2265 0 (the cost can't be negative)",
    "key_point": "In real-world contexts, the domain and range often have practical limitations. For instance, time can't be negative, or a person's height can't be 20 feet."
