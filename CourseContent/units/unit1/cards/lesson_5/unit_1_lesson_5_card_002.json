    "explanation": "To evaluate a function at a specific value, we substitute that value for every occurrence of the variable in the function definition.\n\nFor example, if f(x) = x\u00b2 - 3x + 4, to find f(2), we substitute 2 for every x in the expression:\nf(2) = 2\u00b2 - 3(2) + 4 = 4 - 6 + 4 = 2",
    "example": "If h(t) = 5t - t\u00b2, then h(3) = 5(3) - 3\u00b2 = 15 - 9 = 6",
    "key_point": "When evaluating functions, be careful with the order of operations. Complete all operations within parentheses first, then exponents, followed by multiplication/division, and finally addition/subtraction."
