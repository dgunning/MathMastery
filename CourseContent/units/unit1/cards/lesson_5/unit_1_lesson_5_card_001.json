    "explanation": "Function notation is a way to write functions in a compact form. Instead of writing 'y equals' for a function, we use f(x) to represent the output value when x is the input.\n\nFor example, instead of writing y = 2x + 3, we write f(x) = 2x + 3.\n\nThe notation f(x) is read as 'f of x' and represents the value of the function at x.",
    "example": "If f(x) = x\u00b2 + 1, then f(3) means 'the value of the function when x = 3'.\nf(3) = 3\u00b2 + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10",
    "key_point": "Function notation f(x) doesn't mean f times x. It's a way of naming the function (f) and showing what happens when we input a specific value (x)."
