    "explanation": "These examples demonstrate the three possible cases for linear-quadratic systems:\n\n1. Two Real Solutions (System 1)\n   - The discriminant of the resulting quadratic equation is positive (b\u00b2 - 4ac > 0)\n   - Geometrically, the line intersects the parabola at two distinct points\n   - The solutions may be irrational numbers involving square roots\n\n2. No Real Solutions (Systems 2 and 3)\n   - The discriminant of the resulting quadratic equation is negative (b\u00b2 - 4ac < 0)\n   - Geometrically, the line doesn't intersect the parabola at any point\n   - The algebraic solutions are complex numbers, which don't represent points in the real coordinate plane\n\nThe third case (not shown in these examples) is when the system has exactly one solution, which occurs when the discriminant is zero (b\u00b2 - 4ac = 0). In this case, the line is tangent to the parabola.\n\nThe discriminant test provides a quick way to determine the number of solutions without having to solve the entire system. This is particularly useful when you only need to know how many solutions exist rather than finding the exact solutions."
