    "explanation": "While most linear-quadratic systems have 0, 1, or 2 solutions, there are several special cases that deserve attention. Understanding these cases helps develop a deeper insight into the geometric and algebraic properties of these systems.\n\n1. Horizontal Line and Parabola\n   - When the linear equation has the form y = k (a horizontal line)\n   - The system becomes: y = k and y = ax\u00b2 + bx + c\n   - Setting these equal: k = ax\u00b2 + bx + c\n   - This is a standard quadratic equation in x\n   - The number of solutions depends on the discriminant of this equation\n   - Geometrically, this represents finding where a horizontal line intersects a parabola\n\n2. Vertical Line and Parabola\n   - When the linear equation has the form x = h (a vertical line)\n   - The system becomes: x = h and y = ax\u00b2 + bx + c\n   - Substituting x = h into the quadratic: y = ah\u00b2 + bh + c\n   - This gives exactly one y-value for the given x\n   - The system always has exactly one solution: (h, ah\u00b2 + bh + c)\n   - Geometrically, this represents finding where a vertical line intersects a parabola\n\n3. Line Through the Vertex of a Parabola\n   - The vertex of a parabola y = ax\u00b2 + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a)\n   - If a line passes through this vertex, it may be tangent to the parabola or intersect it twice\n   - If the line has the same slope as the parabola at the vertex (which is zero), then it's tangent\n   - Otherwise, it intersects the parabola at two points\n\n4. Parabola with Axis Parallel to the Line\n   - When the axis of symmetry of the parabola is parallel to the line\n   - This occurs when the slope of the line equals the slope of the axis of symmetry\n   - In this case, the line and parabola may have 0, 1, or 2 intersections\n   - The analysis requires careful consideration of the relative positions\n\n5. Degenerate Cases\n   - When the coefficient of x\u00b2 in the resulting quadratic equation is zero\n   - This happens when the elimination process cancels the quadratic term\n   - The system reduces to a linear equation, which has at most one solution\n   - This represents cases where the line and parabola have special geometric relationships",
    "example": "Example 1: Horizontal Line and Parabola\n\nSolve the system:\ny = 4\ny = x\u00b2 - 2x + 1\n\nSolution:\nSetting the equations equal:\n4 = x\u00b2 - 2x + 1\nx\u00b2 - 2x - 3 = 0\n(x - 3)(x + 1) = 0\nx = 3 or x = -1\n\nSubstituting back to find the y-coordinates:\nFor x = 3: y = 4\nFor x = -1: y = 4\n\nThe solutions are (3, 4) and (-1, 4).\n\nExample 2: Vertical Line and Parabola\n\nSolve the system:\nx = 2\ny = x\u00b2 + 3x - 1\n\nSolution:\nSubstituting x = 2 into the quadratic equation:\ny = 2\u00b2 + 3(2) - 1 = 4 + 6 - 1 = 9\n\nThe solution is (2, 9).\n\nExample 3: Line Through the Vertex of a Parabola\n\nConsider the parabola y = 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 5 and the line y = -2x + 7.\n\nThe vertex of the parabola is at x = -b/(2a) = -(-4)/(2\u00b72) = 4/4 = 1.\nThe y-coordinate of the vertex is y = 2(1)\u00b2 - 4(1) + 5 = 2 - 4 + 5 = 3.\nSo the vertex is at (1, 3).\n\nChecking if the line passes through the vertex:\nAt x = 1: y = -2(1) + 7 = 5 \u2260 3\n\nThe line doesn't pass through the vertex. Let's solve the system:\n-2x + 7 = 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 5\n0 = 2x\u00b2 - 2x - 2\n0 = x\u00b2 - x - 1\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\nx = (1 \u00b1 \u221a(1 + 4))/2 = (1 \u00b1 \u221a5)/2\n\nThe solutions are approximately x \u2248 1.618 and x \u2248 -0.618.\n\nExample 4: Degenerate Case\n\nSolve the system:\ny = 2x + 1\ny = 2x\u00b2 - 2x + 3\n\nSolution:\nSetting the equations equal:\n2x + 1 = 2x\u00b2 - 2x + 3\n0 = 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 2\n0 = x\u00b2 - 2x + 1\n0 = (x - 1)\u00b2\nx = 1\n\nSubstituting back:\ny = 2(1) + 1 = 3\n\nThe system has exactly one solution: (1, 3). This is a case where the line is tangent to the parabola.",
    "key_point": "When dealing with special cases in linear-quadratic systems:\n\n1. Horizontal lines (y = k) intersect a parabola in 0, 1, or 2 points, depending on the relative position of the line and the range of the parabola\n\n2. Vertical lines (x = h) always intersect a parabola exactly once, assuming the parabola opens upward or downward\n\n3. When a line passes through the vertex of a parabola:\n   - If the line has the same slope as the parabola at the vertex, it's tangent to the parabola\n   - Otherwise, it intersects the parabola at two points\n\n4. When the resulting quadratic equation is a perfect square (like (x - a)\u00b2), the system has exactly one solution, and the line is tangent to the parabola\n\n5. Always verify your solutions by checking that they satisfy both original equations, especially in degenerate cases"
