    "explanation": "When working with radical functions, it's essential to understand domain restrictions. The domain of a function is the set of all input values (x-values) for which the function is defined.\n\nFor radical functions, the key domain restrictions are:\n\n1. For even-indexed roots (square root, fourth root, etc.):\n   - The radicand (expression under the radical) must be non-negative\n   - Domain restriction: radicand ≥ 0\n\n2. For odd-indexed roots (cube root, fifth root, etc.):\n   - The radicand can be any real number\n   - No domain restriction based on sign\n\n3. For rational expressions involving radicals:\n   - Avoid division by zero\n   - Domain restriction: denominator ≠ 0\n\nDetermining the domain is crucial for correctly analyzing, graphing, and solving problems involving radical functions.",
    "example": "Examples of finding domains for radical functions:\n\n1. f(x) = √(x - 3)\n   Domain restriction: x - 3 ≥ 0\n   Solving: x ≥ 3\n   Domain: [3, ∞)\n\n2. g(x) = ³√(2x + 1)\n   Since this is a cube root (odd index), there's no restriction on the sign of the radicand\n   Domain: All real numbers, or (-∞, ∞)\n\n3. h(x) = 1/√x\n   Domain restrictions:\n   - x > 0 (for the square root to be defined)\n   - √x ≠ 0 (to avoid division by zero)\n   Since √x = 0 only when x = 0, and we already have x > 0, the domain is (0, ∞)\n\n4. k(x) = √(x² - 4)\n   Domain restriction: x² - 4 ≥ 0\n   Solving: x² ≥ 4\n   x ≤ -2 or x ≥ 2\n   Domain: (-∞, -2] ∪ [2, ∞)",
    "key_point": "Always check domain restrictions when working with radical expressions. These restrictions affect every aspect of working with radical functions, from simplifying expressions to solving equations and graphing."
