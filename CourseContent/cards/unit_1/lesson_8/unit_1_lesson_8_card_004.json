      "Step 1: For √(8x³y⁵), identify the perfect square factors in each term.\n8 = 4 × 2 = 2² × 2\nx³ = x² × x\ny⁵ = y⁴ × y = (y²)² × y",

    "explanation": "When simplifying radicals with variables, we apply the same principles as with numbers, but we need to pay attention to the exponents of each variable.\n\nFor square roots (index 2):\n- Variables with even exponents can be simplified (e.g., √(x⁶) = x³)\n- Variables with odd exponents leave a remainder (e.g., √(x⁵) = x² × √x)\n\nFor cube roots (index 3):\n- Variables with exponents divisible by 3 can be simplified (e.g., ³√(x⁶) = x²)\n- Variables with other exponents leave a remainder (e.g., ³√(x⁵) = x¹ × ³√(x²))\n\nIn general, for a radical with index n, we divide the exponent by n and extract the quotient, leaving the remainder under the radical."
