    "problem": "Solve the following radical equations:\n1. √(2x - 3) = 5\n2. √x + 2 = x - 4",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: For √(2x - 3) = 5, isolate the radical on one side (already done).",
      "Step 2: Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the radical.\n(√(2x - 3))² = 5²\n2x - 3 = 25",
      "Step 3: Solve for x.\n2x - 3 = 25\n2x = 28\nx = 14",
      "Step 4: Check the solution by substituting back into the original equation.\n√(2(14) - 3) = √(28 - 3) = √25 = 5 ✓",
      "Step 5: For √x + 2 = x - 4, rearrange to isolate the radical.\n√x = x - 6",
      "Step 6: Square both sides to eliminate the radical.\n(√x)² = (x - 6)²\nx = x² - 12x + 36",
      "Step 7: Rearrange to standard form and solve the quadratic equation.\n0 = x² - 13x + 36\n0 = (x - 9)(x - 4)\nx = 9 or x = 4",
      "Step 8: Check both solutions in the original equation.\nFor x = 9: √9 + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5 and 9 - 4 = 5 ✓\nFor x = 4: √4 + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4 and 4 - 4 = 0 ✗\nSo x = 9 is the only valid solution."
    ],
    "explanation": "When solving equations involving radicals, the key strategy is to isolate the radical term and then raise both sides of the equation to a power that eliminates the radical.\n\nHowever, this process can introduce extraneous solutions that don't satisfy the original equation. This happens because squaring both sides creates an equivalent equation only when both sides are non-negative.\n\nTherefore, it's crucial to check all potential solutions in the original equation to verify they are valid. This verification step is not optional—it's an essential part of the solution process."
