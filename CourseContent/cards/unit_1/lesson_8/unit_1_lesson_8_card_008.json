    "problem": "Solve the quadratic equation 2x\u00b2 - 12x + 10 = 0 by completing the square.",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: Factor out the leading coefficient from the first two terms\n2x\u00b2 - 12x + 10 = 0\n2(x\u00b2 - 6x) + 10 = 0",
      "Step 2: Move the constant term to the right side\n2(x\u00b2 - 6x) = -10",
      "Step 3: Complete the square inside the parentheses\nFor x\u00b2 - 6x, take half of -6, which is -3, and square it: (-3)\u00b2 = 9\n2(x\u00b2 - 6x + 9 - 9) = -10\n2((x - 3)\u00b2 - 9) = -10",
      "Step 4: Distribute the leading coefficient\n2(x - 3)\u00b2 - 18 = -10",
      "Step 5: Isolate the squared term\n2(x - 3)\u00b2 = 8\n(x - 3)\u00b2 = 4",
      "Step 6: Take the square root of both sides\n\u221a(x - 3)\u00b2 = \u00b1\u221a4\nx - 3 = \u00b12",
      "Step 7: Solve for x\nx - 3 = 2 or x - 3 = -2\nx = 5 or x = 1",
      "Step 8: Verify the solutions\nFor x = 5: 2(5)\u00b2 - 12(5) + 10 = 2(25) - 60 + 10 = 50 - 60 + 10 = 0 \u2713\nFor x = 1: 2(1)\u00b2 - 12(1) + 10 = 2 - 12 + 10 = 0 \u2713"
    ],
    "explanation": "When solving a quadratic equation with a leading coefficient other than 1, we first factor out this coefficient before completing the square. This approach allows us to solve any quadratic equation, regardless of its coefficients."
