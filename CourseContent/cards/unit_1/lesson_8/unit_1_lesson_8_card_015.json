  "duration": 120,
  "content": {
    "explanation": "Let's review the key concepts about completing the square:\n\n1. Completing the square is a technique used to rewrite a quadratic expression in the form (x + p)\u00b2 + q\n\n2. The process involves:\n   - For expressions with a = 1: Add and subtract (b/2)\u00b2 to create a perfect square trinomial\n   - For expressions with a \u2260 1: Factor out a, complete the square inside the parentheses, then distribute\n\n3. Applications of completing the square include:\n   - Converting from standard form to vertex form\n   - Finding the vertex of a quadratic function\n   - Solving quadratic equations\n   - Deriving the quadratic formula\n   - Analyzing maximum and minimum values\n\n4. The vertex form f(x) = a(x - h)\u00b2 + k directly reveals:\n   - The vertex at (h, k)\n   - The direction of opening (upward if a > 0, downward if a < 0)\n   - The maximum or minimum value (k)",
    "example": "For f(x) = 2x\u00b2 - 12x + 10:\n\n1. Factor out the leading coefficient: f(x) = 2(x\u00b2 - 6x) + 10\n2. Complete the square inside: f(x) = 2(x\u00b2 - 6x + 9 - 9) + 10 = 2((x - 3)\u00b2 - 9) + 10\n3. Distribute and simplify: f(x) = 2(x - 3)\u00b2 - 18 + 10 = 2(x - 3)\u00b2 - 8\n4. The vertex is at (3, -8)\n5. Since a = 2 > 0, the parabola opens upward and has a minimum value of -8",
    "key_point": "Completing the square is a versatile technique that connects many concepts in quadratic functions. It provides a geometric understanding of quadratics and is the foundation for the quadratic formula."
