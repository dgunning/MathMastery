    "explanation": "A relation is any set of ordered pairs (x, y) that shows a relationship between inputs and outputs.\n\nA function is a special type of relation where each x-value (input) corresponds to exactly one y-value (output).\n\nIn other words, all functions are relations, but not all relations are functions.",
    "example": "Relation 1: {(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)}\nThis is a function because each input has exactly one output.\n\nRelation 2: {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4)}\nThis is not a function because the input 1 has two different outputs (2 and 3).",
    "key_point": "To determine if a relation is a function, check if any input value is paired with more than one output value. If yes, it's not a function."
