  "content": {
    "explanation": "The vertical line test is a visual way to determine if a graph represents a function.\n\nIf any vertical line intersects the graph at more than one point, then the graph does not represent a function.\n\nThis is because a vertical line represents all points with the same x-value. If it intersects the graph multiple times, that means one x-value has multiple y-values, which violates the definition of a function.",
    "example": "A straight line always passes the vertical line test because any vertical line will intersect it exactly once.\n\nA circle fails the vertical line test because a vertical line through the center intersects the circle at two points.",
    "key_point": "The vertical line test is based on the definition of a function: each input (x-value) must have exactly one output (y-value)."
