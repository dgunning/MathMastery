  "duration": 120,
  "content": {
    "explanation": "Function notation is particularly useful in real-world applications where we need to model relationships between variables.\n\nFor example, if C(x) represents the cost of producing x items, then C(100) would be the cost of producing 100 items.\n\nSimilarly, if h(t) represents the height of a ball t seconds after being thrown, then h(2) would be the height after 2 seconds.",
    "example": "If P(n) = 15n - 200 represents the profit (in dollars) from selling n t-shirts, then P(50) = 15(50) - 200 = 750 - 200 = $550 is the profit from selling 50 t-shirts.",
    "key_point": "In real-world contexts, the variables and function names often have specific meanings. Pay attention to the units and what each variable represents."
