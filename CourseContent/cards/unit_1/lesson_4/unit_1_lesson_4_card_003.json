    "problem": "Determine whether each relation represents a function:\na) {(1, 3), (2, 5), (3, 7), (4, 9)}\nb) {(2, 5), (2, 7), (3, 9)}\nc) {(5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1)}",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: Check if any input value appears more than once with different outputs.\n\nFor relation (a):\nInputs: 1, 2, 3, 4\nEach input appears exactly once, so this is a function.",
      "Step 2: For relation (b):\nInputs: 2, 2, 3\nThe input 2 appears twice with different outputs (5 and 7).\nThis violates the function rule, so relation (b) is not a function.",
      "Step 3: For relation (c):\nInputs: 5, 6, 7\nEach input appears exactly once, even though they all map to the same output.\nThis is a function."
    ],
    "explanation": "Remember: A function can have different inputs that lead to the same output (like in relation c), but it cannot have the same input leading to different outputs (like in relation b)."
