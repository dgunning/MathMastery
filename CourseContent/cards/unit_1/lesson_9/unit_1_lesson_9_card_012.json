    "explanation": "When working with radical functions, it's essential to understand domain restrictions. The domain of a function is the set of all input values (x-values) for which the function is defined.\n\nFor radical functions, the key domain restrictions are:\n\n1. For even-indexed roots (square root, fourth root, etc.):\n   - The radicand (expression under the radical) must be non-negative\n   - Domain restriction: radicand \u2265 0\n\n2. For odd-indexed roots (cube root, fifth root, etc.):\n   - The radicand can be any real number\n   - No domain restriction based on sign\n\n3. For rational expressions involving radicals:\n   - Avoid division by zero\n   - Domain restriction: denominator \u2260 0\n\nDetermining the domain is crucial for correctly analyzing, graphing, and solving problems involving radical functions.",
    "example": "Examples of finding domains for radical functions:\n\n1. f(x) = \u221a(x - 3)\n   Domain restriction: x - 3 \u2265 0\n   Solving: x \u2265 3\n   Domain: [3, \u221e)\n\n2. g(x) = \u00b3\u221a(2x + 1)\n   Since this is a cube root (odd index), there's no restriction on the sign of the radicand\n   Domain: All real numbers, or (-\u221e, \u221e)\n\n3. h(x) = 1/\u221ax\n   Domain restrictions:\n   - x > 0 (for the square root to be defined)\n   - \u221ax \u2260 0 (to avoid division by zero)\n   Since \u221ax = 0 only when x = 0, and we already have x > 0, the domain is (0, \u221e)\n\n4. k(x) = \u221a(x\u00b2 - 4)\n   Domain restriction: x\u00b2 - 4 \u2265 0\n   Solving: x\u00b2 \u2265 4\n   x \u2264 -2 or x \u2265 2\n   Domain: (-\u221e, -2] \u222a [2, \u221e)",
    "key_point": "Always check domain restrictions when working with radical expressions. These restrictions affect every aspect of working with radical functions, from simplifying expressions to solving equations and graphing."
