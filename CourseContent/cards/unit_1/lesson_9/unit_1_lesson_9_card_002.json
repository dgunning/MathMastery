    "explanation": "Radicals follow several important properties that allow us to manipulate and simplify expressions. For any positive real numbers a and b, and any positive integer n:\n\n1. Product Property: \u207f\u221a(a \u00d7 b) = \u207f\u221aa \u00d7 \u207f\u221ab\n   This means the radical of a product equals the product of the radicals.\n\n2. Quotient Property: \u207f\u221a(a \u00f7 b) = \u207f\u221aa \u00f7 \u207f\u221ab\n   This means the radical of a quotient equals the quotient of the radicals.\n\n3. Power Property: \u207f\u221a(a^m) = (\u207f\u221aa)^m\n   This means the radical of a power equals the power of the radical.\n\n4. Root of a Root: \u1d50\u221a(\u207f\u221aa) = \u1d50\u207f\u221aa\n   This means taking successive roots is equivalent to taking a single root with an index equal to the product of the indices.\n\n5. Exponent-Radical Relationship: \u207f\u221aa = a^(1/n)\n   This allows us to convert between radical and exponential forms.",
    "example": "Examples of applying radical properties:\n\n1. Product Property: \u221a(9 \u00d7 4) = \u221a9 \u00d7 \u221a4 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6\n\n2. Quotient Property: \u221a(25 \u00f7 9) = \u221a25 \u00f7 \u221a9 = 5 \u00f7 3 = 5/3\n\n3. Power Property: \u221a(x^4) = (\u221ax)^4 = x^2\n\n4. Root of a Root: \u221a(\u00b3\u221a8) = \u2076\u221a8 = \u2076\u221a(2^3) = 2^(3/6) = 2^(1/2) = \u221a2\n\n5. Exponent-Radical Relationship: \u2074\u221a16 = 16^(1/4) = (2^4)^(1/4) = 2^(4/4) = 2^1 = 2",
