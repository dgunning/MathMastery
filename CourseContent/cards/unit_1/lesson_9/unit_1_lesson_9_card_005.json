    "explanation": "To add or subtract radical expressions, we need to identify like radicals - those with the same index and the same radicand after simplification.\n\nLike radicals can be combined by adding or subtracting their coefficients, similar to how we combine like terms in algebra.\n\nThe key steps are:\n1. Simplify each radical expression completely\n2. Identify like radicals (same index and same radicand)\n3. Combine like radicals by adding or subtracting their coefficients\n4. Leave unlike radicals as separate terms"
