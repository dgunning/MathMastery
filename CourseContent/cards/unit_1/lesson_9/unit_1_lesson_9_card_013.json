    "problem": "Solve the following real-world problems involving radicals:\n\n1. The time (in seconds) it takes an object to fall from a height of h meters is given by t = \u221a(2h/9.8). How long will it take an object to fall from the top of a 45-meter building?\n\n2. The period T (in seconds) of a simple pendulum with length L (in meters) is given by T = 2\u03c0\u221a(L/9.8). Find the length of a pendulum with a period of 2 seconds.",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: For the falling object problem, substitute h = 45 meters into the formula t = \u221a(2h/9.8).\nt = \u221a(2 \u00d7 45/9.8)\nt = \u221a(90/9.8)\nt = \u221a9.18\nt \u2248 3.03 seconds",
      "Step 2: For the pendulum problem, we need to solve for L in the formula T = 2\u03c0\u221a(L/9.8).\nGiven T = 2 seconds, we have:\n2 = 2\u03c0\u221a(L/9.8)",
      "Step 3: Divide both sides by 2\u03c0.\n2/(2\u03c0) = \u221a(L/9.8)\n1/\u03c0 = \u221a(L/9.8)",
      "Step 4: Square both sides.\n(1/\u03c0)\u00b2 = L/9.8\n1/\u03c0\u00b2 = L/9.8",
      "Step 5: Multiply both sides by 9.8.\n9.8/\u03c0\u00b2 = L\nL \u2248 0.994 meters or about 99.4 centimeters"
