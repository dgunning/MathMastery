    "problem": "Solve the following quadratic equations using the quadratic formula:\n1. x² - 5x + 6 = 0\n2. 2x² - 3x - 2 = 0\n3. 3x² - 2x - 1 = 0",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: Recall the quadratic formula for an equation in the form ax² + bx + c = 0:\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac))/(2a)",
      "Step 2: For x² - 5x + 6 = 0, identify the coefficients: a = 1, b = -5, c = 6.",
      "Step 3: Substitute these values into the quadratic formula:\nx = (-(-5) ± √((-5)² - 4(1)(6)))/(2(1))\nx = (5 ± √(25 - 24))/2\nx = (5 ± √1)/2\nx = (5 ± 1)/2\nx = 3 or x = 2",
      "Step 4: For 2x² - 3x - 2 = 0, identify the coefficients: a = 2, b = -3, c = -2.",
      "Step 5: Substitute these values into the quadratic formula:\nx = (-(-3) ± √((-3)² - 4(2)(-2)))/(2(2))\nx = (3 ± √(9 + 16))/4\nx = (3 ± √25)/4\nx = (3 ± 5)/4\nx = 2 or x = -1/2",
      "Step 6: For 3x² - 2x - 1 = 0, identify the coefficients: a = 3, b = -2, c = -1.",
      "Step 7: Substitute these values into the quadratic formula:\nx = (-(-2) ± √((-2)² - 4(3)(-1)))/(2(3))\nx = (2 ± √(4 + 12))/6\nx = (2 ± √16)/6\nx = (2 ± 4)/6\nx = 1 or x = -1/3"

    "explanation": "The quadratic formula is particularly useful when:\n\n1. The quadratic equation doesn't factor easily\n2. You need exact solutions, including irrational numbers\n3. You want to determine the nature of the roots without actually solving\n\nWhen using the quadratic formula:\n\n1. Make sure the equation is in standard form ax² + bx + c = 0\n2. Correctly identify the coefficients a, b, and c\n3. Substitute these values into the formula\n4. Simplify the discriminant (b² - 4ac) first\n5. Calculate both solutions using the ± sign\n6. Simplify the fractions if possible\n\nThe quadratic formula always works, even for equations that could be solved more easily by factoring. However, for equations that factor nicely, factoring is often quicker."
