    "explanation": "Polynomial operations are fundamental to algebraic manipulation. Let's review the key operations:\n\n1. Addition and Subtraction: Combine like terms by adding/subtracting coefficients\n\n2. Multiplication:\n   - Monomial × Monomial: Multiply coefficients and add exponents of like bases\n   - Polynomial × Monomial: Distribute the monomial to each term\n   - Polynomial × Polynomial: Use the distributive property (FOIL for binomials)\n\n3. Division:\n   - Polynomial ÷ Monomial: Divide each term by the monomial\n   - Polynomial ÷ Polynomial: Use long division or synthetic division\n\n4. Special Products:\n   - (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b² (difference of squares)\n   - (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b² (perfect square trinomial)\n   - (a - b)² = a² - 2ab + b² (perfect square trinomial)",
    "example": "Example: Multiply (2x - 3)(x + 4)\n\nUsing FOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last):\nFirst terms: 2x × x = 2x²\nOuter terms: 2x × 4 = 8x\nInner terms: -3 × x = -3x\nLast terms: -3 × 4 = -12\n\nCombining like terms: 2x² + 8x - 3x - 12 = 2x² + 5x - 12",
    "key_point": "When working with polynomials, pay attention to the signs during operations. For subtraction, distribute the negative sign to all terms in the second polynomial. For multiplication, remember the sign rule: same signs yield positive, different signs yield negative."
