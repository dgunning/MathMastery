    "explanation": "The discriminant of a quadratic equation provides valuable information about the graph of the corresponding quadratic function f(x) = ax² + bx + c. The discriminant Δ = b² - 4ac determines how the parabola is positioned relative to the x-axis.\n\n1. Positive Discriminant (Δ > 0):\n   - The parabola crosses the x-axis at two distinct points\n   - These points correspond to the two real roots of the equation\n   - The x-coordinates of these points are given by x = (-b ± √Δ)/(2a)\n\n2. Zero Discriminant (Δ = 0):\n   - The parabola touches (is tangent to) the x-axis at exactly one point\n   - This point corresponds to the repeated root of the equation\n   - The x-coordinate of this point is x = -b/(2a)\n   - This point is also the vertex of the parabola when a > 0\n\n3. Negative Discriminant (Δ < 0):\n   - The parabola doesn't intersect the x-axis at all\n   - The equation has no real roots, only complex roots\n   - If a > 0, the parabola lies entirely above the x-axis\n   - If a < 0, the parabola lies entirely below the x-axis\n\nThe discriminant also relates to the vertex of the parabola. The vertex occurs at x = -b/(2a), and its y-coordinate is f(-b/(2a)) = c - b²/(4a) = (4ac - b²)/(4a) = -Δ/(4a).",
    "example": "Let's examine three quadratic functions with different discriminants:\n\n1. f(x) = x² - 4x + 3\n   Discriminant: Δ = (-4)² - 4(1)(3) = 16 - 12 = 4 > 0\n   The parabola crosses the x-axis at two points: x = 1 and x = 3\n   The vertex is at x = -b/(2a) = 4/2 = 2, with y-coordinate f(2) = -1\n\n2. f(x) = x² - 6x + 9\n   Discriminant: Δ = (-6)² - 4(1)(9) = 36 - 36 = 0\n   The parabola touches the x-axis at one point: x = 3\n   The vertex is at x = 3, with y-coordinate f(3) = 0\n   The parabola can be written as f(x) = (x - 3)²\n\n3. f(x) = x² + 2x + 5\n   Discriminant: Δ = 2² - 4(1)(5) = 4 - 20 = -16 < 0\n   The parabola doesn't intersect the x-axis\n   The vertex is at x = -1, with y-coordinate f(-1) = 4\n   The parabola lies entirely above the x-axis",
    "key_point": "The discriminant provides a direct link between the algebraic properties of a quadratic equation and the geometric properties of its graph. By calculating the discriminant, you can immediately visualize the position of the parabola relative to the x-axis without having to plot points or solve the equation."
