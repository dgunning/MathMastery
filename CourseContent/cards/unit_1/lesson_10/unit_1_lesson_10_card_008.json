    "explanation": "Completing the square is a method for solving quadratic equations by rewriting the quadratic expression as a perfect square trinomial plus or minus a constant. The general steps are:\n\n1. Ensure the coefficient of x\u00b2 is 1 (divide all terms by the leading coefficient if necessary)\n2. Move the constant term to the right side of the equation\n3. Complete the square on the left side by:\n   a. Taking half the coefficient of x and squaring it\n   b. Adding this value to both sides of the equation\n   c. Rewriting the left side as a perfect square trinomial (x + p)\u00b2\n4. Take the square root of both sides\n5. Solve for x\n\nThis method is particularly useful for:\n- Deriving the quadratic formula\n- Converting from standard form to vertex form\n- Understanding the geometric meaning of the solutions"
