    "explanation": "The quadratic formula is particularly useful when:\n\n1. The quadratic equation doesn't factor easily\n2. You need exact solutions, including irrational numbers\n3. You want to determine the nature of the roots without actually solving\n\nWhen using the quadratic formula:\n\n1. Make sure the equation is in standard form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0\n2. Correctly identify the coefficients a, b, and c\n3. Substitute these values into the formula\n4. Simplify the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) first\n5. Calculate both solutions using the \u00b1 sign\n6. Simplify the fractions if possible\n\nThe quadratic formula always works, even for equations that could be solved more easily by factoring. However, for equations that factor nicely, factoring is often quicker."
