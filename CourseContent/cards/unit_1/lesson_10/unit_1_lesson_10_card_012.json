  "title": "The Discriminant in Optimization Problems",
  "duration": 120,
  "content": {
    "problem": "Solve the following optimization problems using the discriminant:\n\n1. A farmer has 100 meters of fencing to enclose a rectangular garden along a straight river. If no fencing is needed along the river, find the dimensions of the garden that will maximize the enclosed area.\n\n2. A company's profit function (in thousands of dollars) for producing x units of a product is given by P(x) = -2x² + 120x - 1000. Determine whether the company can make a profit, and if so, find the range of production levels that will result in a profit.",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: For the garden problem, let's define the variables. Let x be the length of the garden along the river, and y be the width perpendicular to the river.",
      "Step 2: Since no fencing is needed along the river, the perimeter constraint is: x + 2y = 100. Solving for y: y = (100 - x)/2.",
      "Step 3: The area of the garden is A = xy = x((100 - x)/2) = (100x - x²)/2.",
      "Step 4: To maximize the area, we find the critical point by taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero:\ndA/dx = (100 - 2x)/2 = 0\n100 - 2x = 0\nx = 50",
      "Step 5: The second derivative is d²A/dx² = -1 < 0, confirming this is a maximum. So the length along the river should be x = 50 meters.",
      "Step 6: The width is y = (100 - 50)/2 = 25 meters. The maximum area is A = 50 × 25 = 1250 square meters.",
      "Step 7: For the profit problem, the company makes a profit when P(x) > 0, so we need to solve the inequality: -2x² + 120x - 1000 > 0.",
      "Step 8: Let's calculate the discriminant of the quadratic equation -2x² + 120x - 1000 = 0:\nΔ = 120² - 4(-2)(-1000) = 14400 - 8000 = 6400 = 80²",
      "Step 9: Since Δ > 0, the equation has two distinct real roots. Using the quadratic formula:\nx = (-120 ± √6400)/(-4) = (120 ± 80)/4\nx = 50 ± 20\nx = 30 or x = 70",
      "Step 10: Since the leading coefficient is negative (-2), the parabola opens downward, so the profit function is positive between the roots. Therefore, the company makes a profit when 30 < x < 70.",
      "Step 11: To verify, we can check the profit at x = 50 (midway between the roots):\nP(50) = -2(50)² + 120(50) - 1000 = -5000 + 6000 - 1000 = 0\nThis confirms that the maximum profit occurs at x = 50 units, with the profit being positive for production levels between 30 and 70 units."

    "explanation": "In optimization problems involving quadratic functions, the discriminant provides valuable information about the existence and nature of optimal solutions:\n\n1. For maximizing a quadratic function f(x) = ax² + bx + c where a < 0:\n   - The maximum value occurs at x = -b/(2a)\n   - The maximum value is f(-b/(2a)) = -Δ/(4a) + c\n   - If we need to find where f(x) > k for some constant k, we solve the inequality ax² + bx + (c - k) > 0\n   - The discriminant of the equation ax² + bx + (c - k) = 0 determines whether solutions exist\n\n2. For minimizing a quadratic function f(x) = ax² + bx + c where a > 0:\n   - The minimum value occurs at x = -b/(2a)\n   - The minimum value is f(-b/(2a)) = -Δ/(4a) + c\n   - If we need to find where f(x) < k for some constant k, we solve the inequality ax² + bx + (c - k) < 0\n   - The discriminant of the equation ax² + bx + (c - k) = 0 determines whether solutions exist\n\n3. In constrained optimization problems with quadratic objective functions:\n   - We often reduce the problem to a single-variable quadratic function after substituting the constraint\n   - The discriminant helps determine whether the optimal solution is attainable within the constraints\n\nThe sign of the discriminant tells us about the feasibility of the optimization problem:\n- If Δ > 0, there are two distinct x-values where the function equals a given value\n- If Δ = 0, there is exactly one x-value where the function equals a given value\n- If Δ < 0, there are no x-values where the function equals a given value"
