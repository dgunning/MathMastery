    "problem": "Solve the following quadratic equations by factoring:\n1. 2x\u00b2 - 5x - 3 = 0\n2. 6x\u00b2 - 7x - 3 = 0\n3. 3x\u00b2 - 12 = 0",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: For 2x\u00b2 - 5x - 3 = 0, we need to find factors of the form (ax + b)(cx + d) where ac = 2 and bd = -3, and ad + bc = -5.\nSince a and c must multiply to give 2, the possibilities are a = 1, c = 2 or a = 2, c = 1.\nSince b and d must multiply to give -3, the possibilities are b = 1, d = -3 or b = -1, d = 3 or b = 3, d = -1 or b = -3, d = 1.",
      "Step 2: Try different combinations to find the one that gives ad + bc = -5.\nIf a = 1, c = 2, b = 3, d = -1: ad + bc = 1(-1) + 3(2) = -1 + 6 = 5 (wrong sign)\nIf a = 1, c = 2, b = -3, d = 1: ad + bc = 1(1) + (-3)(2) = 1 - 6 = -5 (correct!)\nSo the factorization is (x - 3)(2x + 1).",
      "Step 3: Apply the zero product property.\n(x - 3)(2x + 1) = 0\nx - 3 = 0 or 2x + 1 = 0\nx = 3 or x = -1/2\nSo the solutions are x = 3 or x = -1/2.",
      "Step 4: For 6x\u00b2 - 7x - 3 = 0, we need factors of the form (ax + b)(cx + d) where ac = 6 and bd = -3, and ad + bc = -7.\nPossible pairs for ac = 6: (1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1)\nPossible pairs for bd = -3: (1,-3), (-1,3), (3,-1), (-3,1)",
      "Step 5: Try combinations to find the one that gives ad + bc = -7.\nIf a = 2, c = 3, b = 1, d = -3: ad + bc = 2(-3) + 1(3) = -6 + 3 = -3 (wrong)\nIf a = 3, c = 2, b = -1, d = 3: ad + bc = 3(3) + (-1)(2) = 9 - 2 = 7 (wrong sign)\nIf a = 3, c = 2, b = 1, d = -3: ad + bc = 3(-3) + 1(2) = -9 + 2 = -7 (correct!)\nSo the factorization is (3x + 1)(2x - 3).",
      "Step 6: Apply the zero product property.\n(3x + 1)(2x - 3) = 0\n3x + 1 = 0 or 2x - 3 = 0\nx = -1/3 or x = 3/2\nSo the solutions are x = -1/3 or x = 3/2.",

      "Step 8: This is now in the form x\u00b2 = d, which we can solve using the square root method.\nx = \u00b1\u221a4 = \u00b12\nSo the solutions are x = 2 or x = -2.\nAlternatively, we could factor: 3x\u00b2 - 12 = 3(x\u00b2 - 4) = 3(x - 2)(x + 2) = 0, giving the same solutions."

    "explanation": "When factoring quadratics with a leading coefficient other than 1 (i.e., ax\u00b2 + bx + c where a \u2260 1), we need to find factors of the form (px + q)(rx + s) where:\n\n1. pr = a (the coefficient of x\u00b2)\n2. qs = c (the constant term)\n3. ps + qr = b (the coefficient of x)\n\nThis often requires trying different combinations of factors until we find the correct one. Alternatively, we can use the AC method:\n\n1. Multiply a \u00d7 c\n2. Find two numbers that multiply to give a \u00d7 c and add to give b\n3. Split the middle term using these numbers\n4. Factor by grouping\n\nFor equations that can be simplified to the form x\u00b2 = d, the square root method provides a direct approach."
