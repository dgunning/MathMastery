  "content": {
    "problem": "Solve the following challenging linear-quadratic systems:\n\n1. Find all values of k such that the line y = kx + 2 intersects the parabola y = x² - 4x + 5 at two points with x-coordinates that sum to 3.\n\n2. Find the equation of the line that is tangent to the parabola y = x² + 2x - 3 at the point where x = 1.\n\n3. A line passes through the point (2, 5) and is tangent to the parabola y = x² + 1. Find the equation of this line.",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: For problem 1, we'll first find the x-coordinates of the intersection points between the line y = kx + 2 and the parabola y = x² - 4x + 5.",
      "Step 2: Using the elimination method by setting the two expressions for y equal:\nkx + 2 = x² - 4x + 5\n0 = x² - (k+4)x + 3",
      "Step 3: If the roots of this quadratic equation are r and s, then by Vieta's formulas:\nr + s = k + 4 (sum of roots)\nrs = 3 (product of roots)",
      "Step 4: We're told that r + s = 3, so:\nk + 4 = 3\nk = -1",
      "Step 5: Let's verify this answer by solving the quadratic equation when k = -1:\nx² - (-1+4)x + 3 = 0\nx² - 3x + 3 = 0",
      "Step 6: Using the quadratic formula:\nx = (3 ± √(9-12))/2 = (3 ± √(-3))/2\nThis gives complex roots, which doesn't match our requirement for real intersection points.",
      "Step 7: Let's reconsider the problem. The condition r + s = 3 means that the sum of the x-coordinates is 3, not that k + 4 = 3. Let's set up the equation correctly:",
      "Step 8: For the quadratic equation x² - (k+4)x + 3 = 0, Vieta's formulas give:\nr + s = k + 4\nrs = 3",
      "Step 9: Given that r + s = 3, we have:\nk + 4 = 3\nk = -1",
      "Step 10: Now we need to check if this value of k gives us real intersection points. When k = -1, the quadratic equation becomes:\nx² - 3x + 3 = 0",
      "Step 11: The discriminant is b² - 4ac = (-3)² - 4(1)(3) = 9 - 12 = -3 < 0\nSince the discriminant is negative, there are no real intersection points when k = -1.",
      "Step 12: Let's try a different approach. If the x-coordinates of the intersection points are r and s, and r + s = 3, then the quadratic equation can be written as:\n(x - r)(x - s) = 0\nx² - (r + s)x + rs = 0\nx² - 3x + rs = 0",
      "Step 13: Comparing with our equation x² - (k+4)x + 3 = 0, we get:\n-3 = -(k+4)\nrs = 3\nThis gives us k = -1 again, but we've already verified that this doesn't work.",
      "Step 14: Let's double-check our work. The equation of the line is y = kx + 2, and the equation of the parabola is y = x² - 4x + 5. Setting them equal:\nkx + 2 = x² - 4x + 5\n0 = x² - 4x - kx + 3\n0 = x² - (4+k)x + 3",
      "Step 15: If the roots of this equation are r and s, then r + s = 4+k and rs = 3. If r + s = 3, then:\n4 + k = 3\nk = -1",
      "Step 16: For k = -1, the quadratic equation is x² - 3x + 3 = 0. The discriminant is b² - 4ac = 9 - 12 = -3 < 0, which means there are no real solutions. This contradicts our assumption that the line and parabola intersect at two points.",
      "Step 17: The issue is that we're trying to find k such that the line intersects the parabola at two points AND the x-coordinates sum to 3. Let's approach this differently.",
      "Step 18: For any value of k, the x-coordinates of the intersection points satisfy the quadratic equation x² - (4+k)x + 3 = 0. For these x-coordinates to sum to 3, we need 4+k = 3, which gives k = -1.",
      "Step 19: But we've shown that when k = -1, the discriminant is negative, so there are no real intersection points. This means there is no value of k that satisfies all the given conditions.",
      "Step 20: For problem 2, we need to find the equation of the line tangent to y = x² + 2x - 3 at the point where x = 1.",
      "Step 21: First, let's find the y-coordinate of this point by substituting x = 1 into the parabola equation:\ny = 1² + 2(1) - 3 = 1 + 2 - 3 = 0\nSo the point is (1, 0).",
      "Step 22: The slope of the tangent line at this point equals the derivative of the parabola function at x = 1:\nf'(x) = 2x + 2\nf'(1) = 2(1) + 2 = 4",
      "Step 23: Using the point-slope form of the line equation:\ny - 0 = 4(x - 1)\ny = 4x - 4",
      "Step 24: Therefore, the equation of the tangent line is y = 4x - 4.",
      "Step 25: For problem 3, we need to find the equation of the line that passes through (2, 5) and is tangent to the parabola y = x² + 1.",
      "Step 26: Let's assume the line is tangent to the parabola at the point (a, a² + 1). The slope of the parabola at this point is the derivative:\nf'(a) = 2a",
      "Step 27: So the equation of the tangent line at (a, a² + 1) is:\ny - (a² + 1) = 2a(x - a)\ny = 2ax - 2a² + a² + 1 = 2ax - a² + 1",
      "Step 28: Since this line passes through (2, 5), we have:\n5 = 2a(2) - a² + 1\n5 = 4a - a² + 1\n0 = -a² + 4a - 4\n0 = a² - 4a + 4\n0 = (a - 2)²",
      "Step 29: This gives us a = 2. So the tangent point is (2, 2² + 1) = (2, 5), which is the same as our given point.",
      "Step 30: The slope of the tangent line at x = 2 is f'(2) = 2(2) = 4.",
      "Step 31: Therefore, the equation of the tangent line is:\ny - 5 = 4(x - 2)\ny = 4x - 8 + 5 = 4x - 3"
    ],
    "explanation": "These challenging problems demonstrate advanced applications of linear-quadratic systems and require a combination of algebraic techniques and geometric understanding:\n\n1. Problem 1 illustrates an important insight: not all constraints can be simultaneously satisfied. We found that requiring the line y = kx + 2 to intersect the parabola y = x² - 4x + 5 at two points with x-coordinates summing to 3 leads to k = -1, but this value of k results in no real intersection points. This is a contradiction, indicating that no value of k satisfies all the given conditions.\n\n2. Problem 2 demonstrates how to find the equation of a tangent line to a parabola at a specific point:\n   - First, find the coordinates of the point on the parabola\n   - Calculate the slope of the parabola at that point using the derivative\n   - Use the point-slope form to write the equation of the tangent line\n\n3. Problem 3 shows how to find a line that is both tangent to a parabola and passes through a specific point:\n   - Parameterize the tangent point as (a, a² + 1)\n   - Write the general equation of the tangent line at this point\n   - Use the condition that the line passes through the given point to determine the value of a\n   - Once a is known, find the equation of the tangent line\n\nThese problems highlight the importance of:\n- Carefully analyzing the constraints and checking if they can be simultaneously satisfied\n- Using calculus concepts (derivatives) to find tangent lines\n- Verifying solutions to ensure they meet all the given conditions"
