    "explanation": "The elimination method for solving linear-quadratic systems involves setting two expressions for the same variable equal to each other. This approach has several important characteristics:\n\n1. It directly eliminates one variable, reducing the system to a single-variable equation\n\n2. The resulting equation is always quadratic, which can lead to:\n   - Two real solutions (line intersects parabola twice)\n   - One real solution (line is tangent to parabola)\n   - No real solutions (line doesn't intersect parabola)\n\n3. When dealing with complex or irrational solutions:\n   - Complex solutions indicate no real intersection points\n   - Irrational solutions should be kept in exact form for verification\n\n4. The method works best when both equations are already solved for the same variable\n\n5. For systems where the equations aren't in the right form, you may need to rearrange them first\n\nAs shown in the examples, the elimination method can handle various types of systems, including those with no solutions, irrational solutions, or solutions involving surds (expressions with square roots)."
