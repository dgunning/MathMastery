    "problem": "Solve the following real-world problems using linear-quadratic systems:\n\n1. A farmer has 200 meters of fencing to enclose a rectangular field adjacent to a straight river. If the river forms one side of the rectangle (so no fencing is needed along that side), what dimensions will maximize the area of the field?\n\n2. A company manufactures and sells x units of a product. The cost function is C(x) = x² + 40x + 300, and the revenue function is R(x) = 100x. How many units should be produced to break even?\n\n3. A ball is thrown upward from the ground with an initial velocity of 48 feet per second. At the same moment, another ball is dropped from a height of 64 feet. When will the two balls meet?",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: For problem 1, let's define our variables. Let x be the length of the field along the river, and y be the width perpendicular to the river.",
      "Step 2: Since the river forms one side, we only need fencing for three sides. The perimeter constraint gives us:\nx + 2y = 200\nSolving for y: y = (200 - x)/2 = 100 - x/2",
      "Step 3: The area of the field is A = xy. We want to maximize this area.\nA = x(100 - x/2) = 100x - x²/2",
      "Step 4: To find the maximum area, we take the derivative of A with respect to x and set it equal to zero.\ndA/dx = 100 - x = 0\nx = 100",
      "Step 5: With x = 100, we find y = 100 - 100/2 = 50.",
      "Step 6: Therefore, the dimensions that maximize the area are 100 meters along the river and 50 meters perpendicular to the river. The maximum area is A = 100 × 50 = 5000 square meters.",
      "Step 7: For problem 2, we need to find where revenue equals cost (break-even point).\nR(x) = C(x)\n100x = x² + 40x + 300\n0 = x² - 60x + 300",
      "Step 8: Solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula.\na = 1, b = -60, c = 300\nx = (60 ± √(3600 - 1200))/2 = (60 ± √2400)/2 = (60 ± 48.99)/2",
      "Step 9: x ≈ 54.5 or x ≈ 5.5\nSince we can only produce a whole number of units, the company needs to produce either 6 units or 55 units to break even.",
      "Step 10: Let's verify these solutions:\nFor x = 6: R(6) = 100(6) = 600, C(6) = 6² + 40(6) + 300 = 36 + 240 + 300 = 576\nFor x = 55: R(55) = 100(55) = 5500, C(55) = 55² + 40(55) + 300 = 3025 + 2200 + 300 = 5525\nThese are close but not exact due to rounding. The exact break-even points are at x = 5 + √15 ≈ 5.87 and x = 5 - √15 ≈ 54.13.",
      "Step 11: For problem 3, let's define the height functions for both balls.\nFor the first ball (thrown upward): h₁ = 48t - 16t²\nFor the second ball (dropped): h₂ = 64 - 16t²",
      "Step 12: The balls meet when h₁ = h₂:\n48t - 16t² = 64 - 16t²\n48t = 64\nt = 64/48 = 4/3 seconds",
      "Step 13: Let's verify this solution by finding the height at t = 4/3 seconds:\nh₁ = 48(4/3) - 16(4/3)² = 64 - 16(16/9) = 64 - 256/9 = (576 - 256)/9 = 320/9 ≈ 35.56 feet\nh₂ = 64 - 16(4/3)² = 64 - 16(16/9) = 64 - 256/9 = (576 - 256)/9 = 320/9 ≈ 35.56 feet",
      "Step 14: Therefore, the balls meet at t = 4/3 seconds (or approximately 1.33 seconds) at a height of 320/9 feet (approximately 35.56 feet)."

    "explanation": "These examples demonstrate how linear-quadratic systems arise in various real-world contexts:\n\n1. Optimization Problems\n   - Many optimization problems involve finding the maximum or minimum value of a quadratic function subject to a linear constraint\n   - The method involves expressing one variable in terms of the other using the linear constraint, then substituting into the quadratic function\n   - Taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero finds the optimal value\n\n2. Break-Even Analysis\n   - When cost and revenue functions are set equal to each other, we get a linear-quadratic system\n   - The solutions represent the break-even points where revenue equals cost\n   - In business contexts, we often need to consider additional constraints like whole number quantities\n\n3. Motion Problems\n   - Objects in motion often follow quadratic paths due to gravity\n   - When two objects' paths are set equal, we get a linear-quadratic system\n   - The solutions represent the times when the objects are at the same position\n\nIn all these applications, it's crucial to:\n- Clearly define what the variables represent\n- Set up the equations based on the physical or economic principles involved\n- Solve the resulting system using appropriate algebraic methods\n- Interpret the solutions in the context of the original problem\n- Verify that the solutions make physical or practical sense"
