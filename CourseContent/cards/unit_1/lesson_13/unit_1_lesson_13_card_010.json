    "problem": "1. Determine the value(s) of m for which the system has exactly one solution:\ny = mx - 1\ny = x\u00b2 - 2x + 3\n\n2. For what values of k will the system have no real solutions?\ny = -x + k\ny = x\u00b2 + 4x + 7\n\n3. Find the equation of the line y = mx + b that passes through the point (1, 3) and is tangent to the parabola y = x\u00b2 + 1.",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: For problem 1, we'll use the elimination method by setting the two expressions for y equal to each other.\nmx - 1 = x\u00b2 - 2x + 3",
      "Step 2: Rearrange into standard form.\n0 = x\u00b2 - 2x - mx + 4\n0 = x\u00b2 + (-2-m)x + 4",
      "Step 3: For exactly one solution, the discriminant must be zero.\n\u0394 = (-2-m)\u00b2 - 4(1)(4) = (m+2)\u00b2 - 16 = m\u00b2 + 4m + 4 - 16 = m\u00b2 + 4m - 12 = 0",
      "Step 4: Solve this quadratic equation for m.\nm\u00b2 + 4m - 12 = 0\n(m + 6)(m - 2) = 0\nm = -6 or m = 2",
      "Step 5: Therefore, the system has exactly one solution when m = -6 or m = 2.",
      "Step 6: For problem 2, we'll use the elimination method.\n-x + k = x\u00b2 + 4x + 7",
      "Step 7: Rearrange into standard form.\n0 = x\u00b2 + 5x + (7-k)",
      "Step 8: For no real solutions, the discriminant must be negative.\n\u0394 = 5\u00b2 - 4(1)(7-k) = 25 - 4(7-k) = 25 - 28 + 4k = 4k - 3 < 0",
      "Step 9: Solve this inequality for k.\n4k - 3 < 0\n4k < 3\nk < 3/4",
      "Step 10: Therefore, the system has no real solutions when k < 3/4.",
      "Step 11: For problem 3, we need to find the equation of a line that passes through (1, 3) and is tangent to y = x\u00b2 + 1.",
      "Step 12: First, let's use the point-slope form to express the equation of the line.\ny - 3 = m(x - 1)\ny = mx - m + 3",
      "Step 13: Now we'll use the elimination method to find where this line intersects the parabola.\nmx - m + 3 = x\u00b2 + 1",
      "Step 14: Rearrange into standard form.\n0 = x\u00b2 - mx + (1 + m - 3) = x\u00b2 - mx + (m - 2)",
      "Step 15: For the line to be tangent, the discriminant must be zero.\n\u0394 = (-m)\u00b2 - 4(1)(m-2) = m\u00b2 - 4m + 8 = 0",
      "Step 16: Solve this quadratic equation for m.\nm\u00b2 - 4m + 8 = 0\nUsing the quadratic formula: m = (4 \u00b1 \u221a(16-32))/2 = (4 \u00b1 \u221a(-16))/2",
      "Step 17: Since the discriminant of this equation is negative, there are no real values of m that make the line tangent to the parabola and pass through (1, 3). This means no such line exists.",
      "Step 18: Let's double-check our work. The error was in setting up the problem. Let's try a different approach.",
      "Step 19: If a line is tangent to the parabola y = x\u00b2 + 1 at a point (p, p\u00b2 + 1), then its slope equals the derivative of the parabola at that point: m = 2p.",
      "Step 20: The equation of this tangent line is:\ny - (p\u00b2 + 1) = 2p(x - p)\ny = 2px - 2p\u00b2 + p\u00b2 + 1 = 2px - p\u00b2 + 1",
      "Step 21: For this line to pass through (1, 3), we have:\n3 = 2p(1) - p\u00b2 + 1\n3 = 2p - p\u00b2 + 1\n0 = -p\u00b2 + 2p - 2\n0 = p\u00b2 - 2p + 2",
      "Step 22: Calculate the discriminant of this equation.\n\u0394 = (-2)\u00b2 - 4(1)(2) = 4 - 8 = -4 < 0",
      "Step 23: Since the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions for p. This confirms our earlier conclusion: no line can pass through (1, 3) and be tangent to the parabola y = x\u00b2 + 1."
    ],
    "explanation": "These examples demonstrate how the discriminant can be used to analyze linear-quadratic systems in various contexts:\n\n1. Finding Parameter Values for Specific Solution Types\n   - Setting the discriminant equal to zero (\u0394 = 0) gives us the parameter values that result in exactly one solution\n   - Setting the discriminant to be negative (\u0394 < 0) gives us the parameter values that result in no real solutions\n   - Setting the discriminant to be positive (\u0394 > 0) gives us the parameter values that result in two distinct real solutions\n\n2. Determining the Existence of Tangent Lines\n   - A line is tangent to a parabola if and only if it intersects the parabola at exactly one point\n   - This occurs when the discriminant of the resulting quadratic equation is zero\n   - If the discriminant equation has no real solutions (as in problem 3), then no line with the given constraints exists\n\n3. Geometric Interpretation\n   - The discriminant provides information about the geometric relationship between the line and parabola\n   - It helps us determine whether certain geometric configurations are possible\n\nThe discriminant approach is particularly powerful when dealing with parameters, as it allows us to find conditions without having to solve the entire system for each possible parameter value."
