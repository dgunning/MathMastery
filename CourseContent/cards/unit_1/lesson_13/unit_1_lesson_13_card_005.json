    "explanation": "The elimination method is another algebraic approach for solving linear-quadratic systems. Unlike the substitution method, which involves expressing one variable in terms of the other, the elimination method works by eliminating one of the variables directly.\n\nSteps for the elimination method:\n\n1. Ensure both equations are in the form where y is isolated\n   - Linear equation: y = mx + b\n   - Quadratic equation: y = ax\u00b2 + bx + c\n\n2. Set the two expressions for y equal to each other\n   - This creates an equation with only the x variable\n   - mx + b = ax\u00b2 + bx + c\n\n3. Rearrange into standard form and solve the resulting quadratic equation\n   - ax\u00b2 + (b-m)x + (c-b) = 0\n   - Use factoring, the quadratic formula, or completing the square\n\n4. Find the corresponding y-values\n   - Substitute each x-value into either the linear or quadratic equation\n\n5. Verify the solutions\n   - Check that each ordered pair satisfies both original equations\n\nThe elimination method is particularly useful when:\n- Both equations are already solved for the same variable\n- You want to avoid introducing fractions that might occur with substitution\n- The system involves more complex expressions\n\nThis method is sometimes called the \"equating method\" because it involves setting two expressions for the same variable equal to each other.",
    "example": "Let's solve the following linear-quadratic system using the elimination method:\n\ny = 3x - 1         (linear equation)\ny = x\u00b2 + x - 3     (quadratic equation)\n\nStep 1: Both equations are already in the form where y is isolated.\n\nStep 2: Set the two expressions for y equal to each other:\n3x - 1 = x\u00b2 + x - 3\n\nStep 3: Rearrange into standard form and solve:\n3x - 1 = x\u00b2 + x - 3\n3x - 1 + 3 = x\u00b2 + x\n3x + 2 = x\u00b2 + x\n0 = x\u00b2 - 2x - 2\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\na = 1, b = -2, c = -2\nx = (2 \u00b1 \u221a(4 + 8))/2 = (2 \u00b1 \u221a12)/2 = (2 \u00b1 2\u221a3)/2 = 1 \u00b1 \u221a3\n\nSo x = 1 + \u221a3 \u2248 2.732 or x = 1 - \u221a3 \u2248 -0.732\n\nStep 4: Find the corresponding y-values:\nFor x = 1 + \u221a3:\ny = 3(1 + \u221a3) - 1 = 3 + 3\u221a3 - 1 = 2 + 3\u221a3 \u2248 7.196\n\nFor x = 1 - \u221a3:\ny = 3(1 - \u221a3) - 1 = 3 - 3\u221a3 - 1 = 2 - 3\u221a3 \u2248 -3.196\n\nStep 5: Verify the solutions:\nFor (1 + \u221a3, 2 + 3\u221a3):\n- Linear equation: y = 3(1 + \u221a3) - 1 = 2 + 3\u221a3 \u2713\n- Quadratic equation: y = (1 + \u221a3)\u00b2 + (1 + \u221a3) - 3 = 1 + 2\u221a3 + 3 + 1 + \u221a3 - 3 = 2 + 3\u221a3 \u2713\n\nFor (1 - \u221a3, 2 - 3\u221a3):\n- Linear equation: y = 3(1 - \u221a3) - 1 = 2 - 3\u221a3 \u2713\n- Quadratic equation: y = (1 - \u221a3)\u00b2 + (1 - \u221a3) - 3 = 1 - 2\u221a3 + 3 + 1 - \u221a3 - 3 = 2 - 3\u221a3 \u2713\n\nTherefore, the solutions to the system are the points (1 + \u221a3, 2 + 3\u221a3) and (1 - \u221a3, 2 - 3\u221a3).",
    "key_point": "When using the elimination method for linear-quadratic systems:\n\n1. The key insight is to set the two expressions for the same variable equal to each other, effectively eliminating that variable\n\n2. This approach always leads to a quadratic equation in one variable, which can be solved using standard techniques\n\n3. The elimination method is often algebraically cleaner than substitution when both equations are already solved for the same variable\n\n4. For systems where the linear equation is not already solved for y, you might need to rearrange it first\n\n5. When dealing with irrational solutions, keep exact forms (like 1 + \u221a3) rather than decimal approximations when verifying solutions"
