    "explanation": "The DOMAIN is the complete set of all possible input values (x-values) that a function can accept.\n\nThink of domain like a restaurant menu:\nüçΩÔ∏è The menu shows everything you CAN order (domain)\nüö´ You can't order items not on the menu\n\nSome functions accept any number as input, while others have restrictions. For example, you can't take the square root of a negative number (in real numbers), so ‚àöx has domain restrictions.",
    "example": "üì± Real-world domains:\n‚Ä¢ Phone battery level function: 0% to 100%\n‚Ä¢ Age-based ticket prices: 0 to 120+ years\n‚Ä¢ Video game score: 0 to unlimited points\n‚Ä¢ Temperature in Kelvin: 0 K to unlimited",
    "key_point": "Domain = all x-values the function can handle without breaking."
