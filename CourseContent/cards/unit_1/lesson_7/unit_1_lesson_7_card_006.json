  "content": {
    "problem": "A farmer has 100 meters of fencing to enclose a rectangular field. What dimensions will maximize the area of the field?",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: Define variables and write equations\nLet x = width of the rectangle\nLet y = length of the rectangle\nPerimeter equation: 2x + 2y = 100\nSolve for y: y = (100 - 2x)/2 = 50 - x",
      "Step 2: Write the area as a function of one variable\nArea = x\u00b7y = x(50 - x) = 50x - x\u00b2",
      "Step 3: Identify this as a quadratic function and find its maximum\nA(x) = 50x - x\u00b2 = -x\u00b2 + 50x\nThis is a quadratic function with a = -1 < 0, so it has a maximum value\nThe maximum occurs at x = -b/(2a) = -(50)/(2(-1)) = 50/2 = 25",
      "Step 4: Find the corresponding value of y\ny = 50 - x = 50 - 25 = 25",
      "Step 5: Calculate the maximum area\nArea = x\u00b7y = 25\u00b725 = 625 square meters",
      "Step 6: State the answer\nThe dimensions that maximize the area are 25 meters by 25 meters, giving a maximum area of 625 square meters"
    ],
    "explanation": "This is a classic optimization problem. By expressing the area as a function of one variable, we create a quadratic function whose maximum value gives us the optimal solution. Notice that the maximum area is achieved when the rectangle is a square, which is a general principle for fixed-perimeter problems."
