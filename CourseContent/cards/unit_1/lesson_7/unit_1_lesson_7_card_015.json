  "title": "Maximum and Minimum Values: Key Concepts Review",
  "duration": 120,
  "content": {
    "explanation": "Let's review the key concepts about maximum and minimum values of quadratic functions:\n\n1. Every quadratic function f(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c has either a maximum value (if a < 0) or a minimum value (if a > 0)\n\n2. This maximum or minimum value occurs at the vertex of the parabola\n\n3. The vertex can be found using:\n   - The formula x = -b/(2a) for the x-coordinate, then substituting to find the y-coordinate\n   - Converting to vertex form f(x) = a(x - h)\u00b2 + k, where (h, k) is the vertex\n\n4. The maximum or minimum value determines the range of the function:\n   - For a > 0: range is [minimum value, \u221e)\n   - For a < 0: range is (-\u221e, maximum value]\n\n5. Real-world applications include:\n   - Maximizing area, profit, or revenue\n   - Minimizing cost, time, or distance\n   - Finding the maximum height of projectiles",
    "example": "For f(x) = -2x\u00b2 + 12x - 10:\n- Since a = -2 < 0, the function has a maximum value\n- The vertex is at x = -b/(2a) = -(12)/(2(-2)) = 12/4 = 3\n- The maximum value is f(3) = -2(3)\u00b2 + 12(3) - 10 = -18 + 36 - 10 = 8\n- The range of the function is (-\u221e, 8]\n- In vertex form: f(x) = -2(x - 3)\u00b2 + 8",
    "key_point": "Understanding how to find and interpret maximum and minimum values is essential for solving optimization problems in various fields, including business, engineering, and physics."
