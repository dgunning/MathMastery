    "problem": "A basketball player shoots a ball with an initial height of 2 meters and an initial upward velocity of 14 meters per second. The height h(t) of the ball after t seconds is given by h(t) = -4.9t\u00b2 + 14t + 2. Find the maximum height reached by the ball and the time at which it occurs.",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: Identify that this is a quadratic function with a < 0, so it has a maximum value\nh(t) = -4.9t\u00b2 + 14t + 2, where a = -4.9, b = 14, c = 2",
      "Step 2: Find the t-coordinate of the vertex using t = -b/(2a)\nt = -(14)/(2(-4.9)) = 14/9.8 \u2248 1.43 seconds",
      "Step 3: Calculate the maximum height by evaluating h(1.43)\nh(1.43) = -4.9(1.43)\u00b2 + 14(1.43) + 2\nh(1.43) = -4.9(2.04) + 20.02 + 2\nh(1.43) = -10.00 + 20.02 + 2\nh(1.43) \u2248 12.02 meters",
      "Step 4: State the answer\nThe ball reaches its maximum height of approximately 12.02 meters after 1.43 seconds"
    ],
    "explanation": "Projectile motion is a classic application of quadratic functions in physics. The negative coefficient of t\u00b2 represents the effect of gravity pulling the object downward. The maximum height is found at the vertex of the parabola."

    "question": "A stone is thrown upward from ground level with an initial velocity of 20 meters per second. The height function is h(t) = -4.9t\u00b2 + 20t. What is the maximum height reached by the stone?",
