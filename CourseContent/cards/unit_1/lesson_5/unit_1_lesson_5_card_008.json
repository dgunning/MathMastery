  "duration": 120,
  "content": {
    "explanation": "Function notation has a direct graphical interpretation. For a function f(x), the value f(a) represents the y-coordinate of the point on the graph where x = a.\n\nFor example, if f(3) = 7, this means that the point (3, 7) lies on the graph of the function f.\n\nSimilarly, to find f(a) from a graph, locate x = a on the x-axis, move vertically to the graph, and read the corresponding y-value.",
    "example": "If you see a point (2, 5) on the graph of function g, this means that g(2) = 5.",
    "key_point": "The graph of a function is a visual representation of all its input-output pairs. Every point (x, y) on the graph can be written as (x, f(x))."
