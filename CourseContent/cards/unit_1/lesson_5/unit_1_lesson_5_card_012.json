    "explanation": "The letter used in function notation is arbitrary - it's just a name we give to the function. The same function can be written with different letters.\n\nFor example, these all represent the same function:\nf(x) = 2x + 3\ng(t) = 2t + 3\nh(u) = 2u + 3\n\nSimilarly, we can use different letters for the input variable, as long as we're consistent within the function definition.",
    "example": "If f(x) = x\u00b2 - 4x + 7, we could also write this as f(p) = p\u00b2 - 4p + 7 or even g(x) = x\u00b2 - 4x + 7. All these represent the same mathematical relationship.",
    "key_point": "What matters in a function is the relationship between inputs and outputs, not the specific letters used to represent them. However, in context, certain letters may be chosen to have specific meaning (like t for time)."
