    "problem": "For each of the following quadratic functions:\n1. Calculate the discriminant\n2. Determine the position of the parabola relative to the x-axis\n3. Find the vertex of the parabola\n\nFunctions:\na) f(x) = 2x\u00b2 - 4x - 6\nb) f(x) = 3x\u00b2 + 6x + 3\nc) f(x) = -x\u00b2 + 6x - 9",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: For function a) f(x) = 2x\u00b2 - 4x - 6, identify the coefficients: a = 2, b = -4, c = -6.",
      "Step 2: Calculate the discriminant for function a):\n\u0394 = b\u00b2 - 4ac\n\u0394 = (-4)\u00b2 - 4(2)(-6)\n\u0394 = 16 + 48\n\u0394 = 64",
      "Step 3: Since \u0394 = 64 > 0, the parabola crosses the x-axis at two distinct points. The roots are:\nx = (-b \u00b1 \u221a\u0394)/(2a)\nx = (4 \u00b1 \u221a64)/(2(2))\nx = (4 \u00b1 8)/4\nx = 3 or x = -1\nSo the parabola crosses the x-axis at x = -1 and x = 3.",
      "Step 4: The vertex of the parabola occurs at x = -b/(2a) = -(-4)/(2(2)) = 4/4 = 1.\nThe y-coordinate of the vertex is f(1) = 2(1)\u00b2 - 4(1) - 6 = 2 - 4 - 6 = -8.\nSo the vertex is at (1, -8).",

      "Step 6: Calculate the discriminant for function b):\n\u0394 = b\u00b2 - 4ac\n\u0394 = 6\u00b2 - 4(3)(3)\n\u0394 = 36 - 36\n\u0394 = 0",
      "Step 7: Since \u0394 = 0, the parabola touches the x-axis at exactly one point. The root is:\nx = -b/(2a) = -6/(2(3)) = -6/6 = -1\nSo the parabola touches the x-axis at x = -1.",
      "Step 8: The vertex of the parabola occurs at x = -b/(2a) = -6/(2(3)) = -1.\nThe y-coordinate of the vertex is f(-1) = 3(-1)\u00b2 + 6(-1) + 3 = 3 - 6 + 3 = 0.\nSo the vertex is at (-1, 0), which is also the point where the parabola touches the x-axis.",
      "Step 9: For function c) f(x) = -x\u00b2 + 6x - 9, identify the coefficients: a = -1, b = 6, c = -9.",
      "Step 10: Calculate the discriminant for function c):\n\u0394 = b\u00b2 - 4ac\n\u0394 = 6\u00b2 - 4(-1)(-9)\n\u0394 = 36 - 36\n\u0394 = 0",
      "Step 11: Since \u0394 = 0, the parabola touches the x-axis at exactly one point. The root is:\nx = -b/(2a) = -6/(2(-1)) = -6/(-2) = 3\nSo the parabola touches the x-axis at x = 3.",
      "Step 12: The vertex of the parabola occurs at x = -b/(2a) = -6/(2(-1)) = 3.\nThe y-coordinate of the vertex is f(3) = -(3)\u00b2 + 6(3) - 9 = -9 + 18 - 9 = 0.\nSo the vertex is at (3, 0), which is also the point where the parabola touches the x-axis.\nNote that since a < 0, this parabola opens downward, and the vertex is the highest point on the parabola."
    ],
    "explanation": "The discriminant provides key information about the position of a parabola relative to the x-axis:\n\n1. When \u0394 > 0:\n   - The parabola crosses the x-axis at two distinct points\n   - If a > 0, the parabola opens upward and has a minimum value\n   - If a < 0, the parabola opens downward and has a maximum value\n\n2. When \u0394 = 0:\n   - The parabola touches the x-axis at exactly one point\n   - This point is also the vertex of the parabola\n   - The quadratic function can be written in the form f(x) = a(x - h)\u00b2\n\n3. When \u0394 < 0:\n   - The parabola doesn't intersect the x-axis\n   - If a > 0, the parabola lies entirely above the x-axis\n   - If a < 0, the parabola lies entirely below the x-axis\n\nThe vertex of the parabola always occurs at x = -b/(2a), regardless of the discriminant. The y-coordinate of the vertex is related to the discriminant by the formula f(-b/(2a)) = -\u0394/(4a)."
