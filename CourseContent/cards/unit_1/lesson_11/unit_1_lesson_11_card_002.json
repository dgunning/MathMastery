    "problem": "Find the quadratic equation in standard form (ax² + bx + c = 0) with the given roots:\n\n1. Roots: 2 and 7, with a = 1\n2. Roots: -3 and 4, with a = 2\n3. Roots: 1/2 and 3/4, with a = 8",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: For a quadratic equation with roots r and s, we can write it in factored form as a(x - r)(x - s) = 0.",
      "Step 2: For problem 1, with roots 2 and 7 and a = 1, the factored form is (x - 2)(x - 7) = 0.",
      "Step 3: Expand the factored form: (x - 2)(x - 7) = x² - 7x - 2x + 14 = x² - 9x + 14.",
      "Step 4: Therefore, the quadratic equation is x² - 9x + 14 = 0.",
      "Step 5: We can verify this is correct by checking that the roots satisfy the equation:\nFor x = 2: 2² - 9(2) + 14 = 4 - 18 + 14 = 0 ✓\nFor x = 7: 7² - 9(7) + 14 = 49 - 63 + 14 = 0 ✓",
      "Step 6: For problem 2, with roots -3 and 4 and a = 2, the factored form is 2(x - (-3))(x - 4) = 2(x + 3)(x - 4).",
      "Step 7: Expand the factored form: 2(x + 3)(x - 4) = 2(x² - 4x + 3x - 12) = 2(x² - x - 12) = 2x² - 2x - 24.",
      "Step 8: Therefore, the quadratic equation is 2x² - 2x - 24 = 0, which can be simplified to x² - x - 12 = 0.",
      "Step 9: For problem 3, with roots 1/2 and 3/4 and a = 8, the factored form is 8(x - 1/2)(x - 3/4).",
      "Step 10: Expand the factored form: 8(x - 1/2)(x - 3/4) = 8(x² - (3/4)x - (1/2)x + (1/2)(3/4)) = 8(x² - (5/4)x + 3/8).",
      "Step 11: Multiply each term by 8: 8(x² - (5/4)x + 3/8) = 8x² - 10x + 3.",
      "Step 12: Therefore, the quadratic equation is 8x² - 10x + 3 = 0."

    "explanation": "When finding a quadratic equation from its roots, we can use either of these methods:\n\n1. Factored Form Method:\n   - Write the equation in factored form: a(x - r)(x - s) = 0\n   - Expand and simplify to get the standard form: ax² + bx + c = 0\n\n2. Coefficient Relationships Method:\n   - Use the relationships between coefficients and roots:\n     - b = -a(r + s)\n     - c = ars\n   - Substitute these values into ax² + bx + c = 0\n\nBoth methods will give the same result. The factored form method is often more intuitive, especially when the roots are simple numbers. The coefficient relationships method can be more efficient when the roots are complex or when only the sum and product of roots are known.\n\nWhen working with fractional roots, be careful with the algebra during expansion. It's often helpful to find a common denominator or to multiply through by an appropriate factor to eliminate fractions."
