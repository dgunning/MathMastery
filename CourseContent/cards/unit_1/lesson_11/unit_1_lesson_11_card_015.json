    "explanation": "In this lesson, we've explored various methods for determining a quadratic equation from information about its roots and other properties. Let's review the key concepts and techniques:\n\n1. Factored Form Method\n   - When given the roots r and s of a quadratic equation, we can write it in factored form:\n     a(x - r)(x - s) = 0\n   - Expanding this form gives us the standard form: ax² + bx + c = 0\n   - This method works for all types of roots: real, rational, irrational, and complex\n\n2. Vieta's Formulas\n   - For a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0 with roots r and s:\n     - r + s = -b/a (Sum of roots)\n     - r × s = c/a (Product of roots)\n   - These formulas allow us to find the coefficients directly from the sum and product of roots\n\n3. Working with Complex Roots\n   - Complex roots always occur in conjugate pairs (a + bi and a - bi) for quadratic equations with real coefficients\n   - When expanding (x - (a + bi))(x - (a - bi)), we get (x - a)² + b²\n\n4. Additional Constraints\n   - When given one root and a point on the graph, we can find the complete equation\n   - When given the vertex and a root, we can determine the equation using the vertex form\n   - When given the discriminant and other information, we can find equations that satisfy all constraints\n\n5. Special Cases\n   - Repeated roots: When r = s, the equation has the form a(x - r)²\n   - Integer/rational coefficients with irrational roots: The roots must be conjugate pairs or expressible in a form that eliminates the irrationality when expanded\n\n6. Applications\n   - Finding quadratic models for real-world phenomena when we know when the function equals zero\n   - Constructing quadratic equations with specific properties for mathematical analysis\n   - Determining the equation of a parabola from its graph or key features",
    "example": "Let's review with a comprehensive example that combines multiple concepts:\n\nSuppose we want to find a quadratic function f(x) with the following properties:\n- One root is 2\n- The vertex is at (1, -3)\n- The function has the form f(x) = ax² + bx + c\n\nStep 1: Since the vertex is at (1, -3), we can write the function in vertex form:\nf(x) = a(x - 1)² - 3\n\nStep 2: Since 2 is a root, f(2) = 0:\n0 = a(2 - 1)² - 3\n0 = a - 3\na = 3\n\nStep 3: Therefore, the function is f(x) = 3(x - 1)² - 3\n\nStep 4: Expand to standard form:\nf(x) = 3(x² - 2x + 1) - 3\nf(x) = 3x² - 6x + 3 - 3\nf(x) = 3x² - 6x\n\nStep 5: Verify our solution:\n- f(2) = 3(2)² - 6(2) = 12 - 12 = 0 ✓ (2 is a root)\n- The vertex occurs at x = -b/(2a) = -(-6)/(2(3)) = 1 ✓\n- The vertex value is f(1) = 3(1)² - 6(1) = 3 - 6 = -3 ✓\n\nStep 6: Find the other root by solving 3x² - 6x = 0:\nx(3x - 6) = 0\nx = 0 or x = 2\n\nSo the roots are 0 and 2, and the quadratic function is f(x) = 3x² - 6x.",
    "key_point": "When determining a quadratic equation from information about its roots or other properties, remember these key strategies:\n\n1. Choose the most appropriate form based on the given information:\n   - Standard form: ax² + bx + c = 0\n   - Factored form: a(x - r)(x - s) = 0\n   - Vertex form: a(x - h)² + k\n\n2. Use Vieta's formulas to connect the coefficients to the roots:\n   - b = -a(r + s)\n   - c = a(r × s)\n\n3. For complex or irrational roots, look for patterns that produce rational coefficients\n\n4. Always verify your solution by checking that it satisfies all the given conditions\n\n5. Remember that additional constraints (beyond the roots) are often needed to uniquely determine a quadratic equation"
