    "explanation": "Every quadratic function has either a maximum or a minimum value, which occurs at the vertex of its parabola.\n\nFor a quadratic function f(x) = ax² + bx + c:\n- If a > 0, the parabola opens upward and has a minimum value at the vertex\n- If a < 0, the parabola opens downward and has a maximum value at the vertex\n\nThe value of the function at the vertex is the maximum or minimum value of the function.",
    "example": "For f(x) = 2x² - 8x + 7:\n- Since a = 2 > 0, the parabola opens upward and has a minimum value\n- The vertex is at x = -b/(2a) = -(-8)/(2(2)) = 8/4 = 2\n- The minimum value is f(2) = 2(2)² - 8(2) + 7 = 8 - 16 + 7 = -1",
    "key_point": "The sign of the leading coefficient 'a' tells us whether the quadratic function has a maximum (a < 0) or minimum (a > 0) value."
