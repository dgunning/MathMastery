  "duration": 120,
  "content": {
    "explanation": "The vertex form of a quadratic function is:\n\nf(x) = a(x - h)\u00b2 + k\n\nwhere (h, k) is the vertex of the parabola and a determines whether the parabola opens upward (a > 0) or downward (a < 0).\n\nThis form is particularly useful because it immediately tells us the vertex without requiring any calculations.",
    "example": "For the function f(x) = 2(x - 3)\u00b2 + 4:\n- The vertex is at (3, 4)\n- Since a = 2 > 0, the parabola opens upward\n- This is a minimum point",
    "key_point": "Converting a quadratic function from standard form (ax\u00b2 + bx + c) to vertex form allows us to easily identify the vertex. This conversion can be done by completing the square, which we'll explore in later lessons."
