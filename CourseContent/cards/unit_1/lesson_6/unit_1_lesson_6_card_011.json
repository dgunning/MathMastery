    "problem": "Graph the quadratic function f(x) = -2(x - 3)\u00b2 + 4 by identifying key points.",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: Identify the vertex from the vertex form\nThe function is already in vertex form f(x) = a(x - h)\u00b2 + k\nComparing with our function, h = 3, k = 4\nSo the vertex is at (3, 4)",
      "Step 2: Determine the direction of opening\nSince a = -2 < 0, the parabola opens downward\nThis means the vertex is a maximum point",
      "Step 3: Find additional points by substituting values on either side of the vertex\nLet's try x = 2 and x = 4 (one unit away from the vertex in each direction)\nf(2) = -2(2 - 3)\u00b2 + 4 = -2(1)\u00b2 + 4 = -2 + 4 = 2\nf(4) = -2(4 - 3)\u00b2 + 4 = -2(1)\u00b2 + 4 = -2 + 4 = 2",
      "Step 4: Find points two units away from the vertex\nf(1) = -2(1 - 3)\u00b2 + 4 = -2(4) + 4 = -8 + 4 = -4\nf(5) = -2(5 - 3)\u00b2 + 4 = -2(4) + 4 = -8 + 4 = -4",
      "Step 5: Plot the points (1, -4), (2, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (5, -4) and connect them with a smooth curve"
    ],
    "explanation": "When graphing a parabola, the vertex gives us the highest or lowest point. By finding additional points at equal distances from the vertex, we can take advantage of the parabola's symmetry to create an accurate graph."
