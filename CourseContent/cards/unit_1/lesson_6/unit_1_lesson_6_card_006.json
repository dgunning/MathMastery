    "problem": "Convert the quadratic function f(x) = 2x\u00b2 - 12x + 19 to vertex form and identify the vertex.",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: Factor out the leading coefficient (a) from the first two terms\nf(x) = 2(x\u00b2 - 6x) + 19",
      "Step 2: Complete the square inside the parentheses\nTo complete the square for x\u00b2 - 6x, take half the coefficient of x, square it, and add and subtract it\nHalf of -6 is -3, and (-3)\u00b2 = 9\nf(x) = 2(x\u00b2 - 6x + 9 - 9) + 19\nf(x) = 2((x - 3)\u00b2 - 9) + 19",
      "Step 3: Distribute and simplify\nf(x) = 2(x - 3)\u00b2 - 18 + 19\nf(x) = 2(x - 3)\u00b2 + 1",
      "Step 4: Identify the vertex from the vertex form\nThe vertex form is f(x) = a(x - h)\u00b2 + k where (h, k) is the vertex\nComparing with our result: h = 3, k = 1\nSo the vertex is (3, 1)"
    ],
    "explanation": "Converting to vertex form by completing the square allows us to easily identify the vertex. This method works for any quadratic function and is especially useful when the vertex isn't easily found using the formula."
