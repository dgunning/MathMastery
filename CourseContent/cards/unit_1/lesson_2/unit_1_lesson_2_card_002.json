    "explanation": "The Greatest Common Factor (GCF) is the largest factor that divides all terms in an expression. Finding the GCF is the first step in many factoring problems.\n\nTo find the GCF of a polynomial:\n\n1. Find the GCF of all coefficients (the numbers)\n2. Find the common variables with the lowest exponents\n3. Multiply these together",
    "example": "To find the GCF of 12x³y² and 18x²y⁴:\n\n1. GCF of 12 and 18 is 6\n2. Common variables with lowest exponents: x² and y²\n3. GCF = 6x²y²",
    "key_point": "Always look for the GCF first before trying other factoring methods. Factoring out the GCF often simplifies the remaining expression and makes further factoring easier."
