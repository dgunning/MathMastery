    "explanation": "Factoring is the process of breaking down an expression into a product of simpler expressions. It's like breaking down a number into its prime factors.\n\nFor example, the number 12 can be factored as 3 × 4, or even further as 2 × 2 × 3.\n\nIn algebra, we do the same thing with expressions like x² + 5x + 6, breaking them down into simpler expressions that multiply to give the original.",
    "example": "Just as 12 = 3 × 4, the expression x² + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)",
    "key_point": "Factoring is the reverse of multiplication. We start with an expression and find what simpler expressions can be multiplied together to create it."
