    "steps": [
      "Step 1: Look for common factors first\n2x⁵ - 32x³ = 2x³(x² - 16)",
      "Step 2: Check if remaining factor can be factored\nx² - 16 is a difference of squares",
      "Step 3: Factor the difference of squares\nx² - 16 = (x + 4)(x - 4)",
      "Step 4: Write the complete factorization\n2x⁵ - 32x³ = 2x³(x + 4)(x - 4)"
