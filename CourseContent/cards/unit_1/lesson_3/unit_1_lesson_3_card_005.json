    "problem": "Factor: 3x\u00b2 + 14x + 8",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: Calculate ac = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24",
      "Step 2: Find factors of 24 that add to 14\nFactors: 2 and 12 (since 2 \u00d7 12 = 24 and 2 + 12 = 14)",
      "Step 3: Split the middle term using these numbers\n3x\u00b2 + 14x + 8 = 3x\u00b2 + 2x + 12x + 8",
      "Step 4: Group the terms in pairs\n= (3x\u00b2 + 2x) + (12x + 8)",
      "Step 5: Factor out common factors from each group\n= x(3x + 2) + 4(3x + 2)",
      "Step 6: Factor out the common binomial\n= (3x + 2)(x + 4)"

    "explanation": "The key insight is that we deliberately split 14x into 2x + 12x so that we could create groups with common factors."
