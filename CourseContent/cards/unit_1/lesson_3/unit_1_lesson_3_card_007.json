    "problem": "Find the domain and range of the function shown in the graph of a parabola opening downward with vertex at (2, 5) and x-intercepts at (0, 0) and (4, 0).",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: To find the domain, look at all possible x-values on the graph.\nThe graph extends horizontally from x = 0 to x = 4.\nSo the domain is [0, 4].",
      "Step 2: To find the range, look at all possible y-values on the graph.\nThe lowest y-value is 0 (at the x-intercepts).\nThe highest y-value is 5 (at the vertex).\nSo the range is [0, 5]."
    ],
    "explanation": "When finding domain and range from a graph, the domain is the set of all x-coordinates and the range is the set of all y-coordinates. For a parabola opening downward, the maximum y-value occurs at the vertex."
