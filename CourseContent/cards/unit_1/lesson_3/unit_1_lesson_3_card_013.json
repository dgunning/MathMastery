    "problem": "Find the range of the quadratic function f(x) = -2x² + 8x - 5.",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: Rewrite the function in vertex form to identify the maximum value\nf(x) = -2x² + 8x - 5\nf(x) = -2(x² - 4x) - 5\nf(x) = -2(x² - 4x + 4 - 4) - 5\nf(x) = -2(x - 2)² + 8 - 5\nf(x) = -2(x - 2)² + 3",
      "Step 2: Identify the vertex\nThe vertex is at x = 2, and f(2) = 3",
      "Step 3: Determine the range\nSince the coefficient of x² is negative (-2), the parabola opens downward\nThis means the vertex is the maximum point\nAs x moves away from 2 in either direction, f(x) decreases without bound\nTherefore, the range is (-∞, 3]"
    ],
    "explanation": "For quadratic functions, the range depends on whether the parabola opens upward or downward. If the coefficient of x² is negative, the parabola opens downward and has a maximum value at the vertex. If the coefficient is positive, it opens upward and has a minimum value."
