    "explanation": "A system of equations consists of two or more equations that are solved simultaneously. For linear systems in two variables, there are three possible outcomes:\n\n1. One unique solution: The lines intersect at exactly one point\n2. No solution: The lines are parallel (inconsistent system)\n3. Infinitely many solutions: The lines are identical (dependent system)\n\nMethods for solving linear systems include:\n\n1. Substitution: Solve one equation for a variable and substitute into the other\n2. Elimination: Add or subtract equations to eliminate a variable\n3. Graphing: Find the intersection point of the graphs",
    "example": "Solve the system:\n2x + 3y = 12\nx - y = 1\n\nUsing elimination:\nStep 1: Multiply the second equation by 3\n2x + 3y = 12\n3x - 3y = 3\n\nStep 2: Add the equations\n5x = 15\n\nStep 3: Solve for x\nx = 3\n\nStep 4: Substitute back to find y\n3 - y = 1\ny = 2\n\nThe solution is (3, 2)",
    "key_point": "When solving systems of equations, choose the most efficient method based on the equations. Elimination works well when coefficients can be easily matched, while substitution is better when a variable has a coefficient of 1."
