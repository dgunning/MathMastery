    "explanation": "A function is a relation that assigns exactly one output to each input. To determine if a relation is a function, check that each input (x-value) corresponds to exactly one output (y-value).\n\nThe domain is the set of all possible input values. The range is the set of all possible output values.\n\nWhen evaluating functions, remember that f(x) represents the output value of the function f for the input x.",
    "example": "For the function f(x) = 2x² - 3x + 1:\n- If x = 2, then f(2) = 2(2)² - 3(2) + 1 = 8 - 6 + 1 = 3\n- Domain: all real numbers\n- Range: y ≥ -1.125 (since it's a parabola opening upward)",
    "key_point": "When checking if a relation is a function, remember the vertical line test: if any vertical line intersects the graph more than once, the relation is not a function."
