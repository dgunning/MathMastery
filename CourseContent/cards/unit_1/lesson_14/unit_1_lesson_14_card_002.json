    "explanation": "Factoring is the process of rewriting an expression as a product of simpler expressions. Key factoring techniques include:\n\n1. Greatest Common Factor (GCF): Factor out the largest common factor from all terms\n\n2. Factoring trinomials: For ax² + bx + c\n   - When a = 1: Find two numbers that multiply to c and add to b\n   - When a ≠ 1: Use the AC method or factoring by grouping\n\n3. Special patterns:\n   - Difference of squares: a² - b² = (a+b)(a-b)\n   - Perfect square trinomials: a² + 2ab + b² = (a+b)²",
    "example": "Example: Factor 6x² + 13x - 5\n\nStep 1: Find two numbers that multiply to ac = 6(-5) = -30 and add to b = 13\n   The numbers are 15 and -2 since 15(-2) = -30 and 15 + (-2) = 13\n\nStep 2: Rewrite the middle term using these numbers\n   6x² + 15x - 2x - 5\n\nStep 3: Factor by grouping\n   3x(2x + 5) - 1(2x + 5) = (3x - 1)(2x + 5)",
    "key_point": "Always look for the GCF first before applying other factoring techniques. This simplifies the subsequent factoring steps and ensures you find the complete factorization."
