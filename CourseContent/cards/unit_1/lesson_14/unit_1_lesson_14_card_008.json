    "problem": "Given the functions f(x) = 2x - 3 and g(x) = x² + 1:\n\n1. Find (f ∘ g)(x) and (g ∘ f)(x).\n2. Evaluate (f ∘ g)(2) and (g ∘ f)(2).\n3. Describe the transformation that occurs when the function h(x) = x² is modified to become k(x) = -2(x - 3)² + 4.",
    "solution": "1. Finding function compositions:\n\n   (f ∘ g)(x) = f(g(x)) = f(x² + 1) = 2(x² + 1) - 3 = 2x² + 2 - 3 = 2x² - 1\n\n   (g ∘ f)(x) = g(f(x)) = g(2x - 3) = (2x - 3)² + 1 = 4x² - 12x + 9 + 1 = 4x² - 12x + 10\n\n2. Evaluating at x = 2:\n\n   (f ∘ g)(2) = f(g(2)) = f(2² + 1) = f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7\n\n   (g ∘ f)(2) = g(f(2)) = g(2(2) - 3) = g(4 - 3) = g(1) = 1² + 1 = 2\n\n3. Describing the transformation from h(x) = x² to k(x) = -2(x - 3)² + 4:\n\n   Step 1: h(x) = x² → (x - 3)²\n   This shifts the parabola to the right by 3 units (horizontal translation).\n\n   Step 2: (x - 3)² → -2(x - 3)²\n   This vertically stretches the parabola by a factor of 2 and reflects it across the x-axis (opens downward).\n\n   Step 3: -2(x - 3)² → -2(x - 3)² + 4\n   This shifts the parabola upward by 4 units (vertical translation).\n\n   Overall transformation: The function k(x) is the original function h(x) = x², shifted right 3 units, reflected and stretched vertically by a factor of 2, and shifted up 4 units. The vertex of this parabola is at (3, 4), and the parabola opens downward.",
    "insight": "Function composition is not commutative, meaning (f ∘ g)(x) is usually different from (g ∘ f)(x). When analyzing function transformations, it's helpful to track changes step-by-step: horizontal shifts affect the input (inside parentheses), while vertical shifts, stretches, and reflections affect the output (outside operations)."
