## Answer Key

### Part A: Multiple Choice
1. a) sin(θ)/cos(θ)
2. b) 10 units
3. a) 45°
4. c) 2π/3
5. d) Quadrant IV

### Part B: Short Answer

6. If sin(θ) = 4/5 and θ is in the first quadrant:
   Using the Pythagorean identity sin²(θ) + cos²(θ) = 1
   cos²(θ) = 1 - sin²(θ) = 1 - (4/5)² = 1 - 16/25 = 9/25
   cos(θ) = 3/5 (positive in first quadrant)
   tan(θ) = sin(θ)/cos(θ) = (4/5)/(3/5) = 4/3

7. In a 45°-45°-90° triangle:
   sin(45°) = 1/√2 = √2/2
   cos(45°) = 1/√2 = √2/2
   tan(45°) = sin(45°)/cos(45°) = 1

8. cos(150°) = cos(180° - 30°) = -cos(30°) = -√3/2
   (Using the reference angle 30° and the fact that cosine is negative in the second quadrant)

9. For y = 3cos(2x - π) + 1:
   Amplitude = 3
   Period = 2π/2 = π
   Phase shift = π/2 (to the right)
   Vertical shift = 1 unit up

10. Coterminal angles with 60°:
    Positive: 60° + 360° = 420°, 60° + 720° = 780°
    Negative: 60° - 360° = -300°, 60° - 720° = -660°

### Part C: Problem Solving

11. Using the Pythagorean theorem:
    Let h be the height up the wall
    h² + 2² = 5²
    h² = 25 - 4 = 21
    h = √21 ≈ 4.58 meters
    
    The angle with the ground:
    θ = sin⁻¹(h/5) = sin⁻¹(√21/5) ≈ sin⁻¹(0.9165) ≈ 66.4°
    
    The ladder reaches approximately 4.58 meters up the wall and makes an angle of approximately 66.4° with the ground.

12. For y = 2sin(x/2):
    Amplitude = 2
    Period = 2π/(1/2) = 4π = 720°
    
    Key points:
    (0°, 0)
    (90°, 2)
    (180°, 0)
    (270°, -2)
    (360°, 0)
    (450°, 2)
    (540°, 0)
    (630°, -2)
    (720°, 0)
    
    [Graph would show one complete cycle of a sine wave with amplitude 2]

13. Let h be the height of the building and d be the distance from the initial position to the building.
    
    From the first position:
    tan(32°) = h/d
    h = d·tan(32°)
    
    From the second position:
    tan(58°) = h/(d-50)
    h = (d-50)·tan(58°)
    
    Setting these equal:
    d·tan(32°) = (d-50)·tan(58°)
    d·tan(32°) = d·tan(58°) - 50·tan(58°)
    d·tan(32°) - d·tan(58°) = -50·tan(58°)
    d(tan(32°) - tan(58°)) = -50·tan(58°)
    d = 50·tan(58°)/(tan(58°) - tan(32°))
    d = 50·1.6003/(1.6003 - 0.6249)
    d = 50·1.6003/0.9754 ≈ 82.0 meters
    
    Now we can find the height:
    h = d·tan(32°) = 82.0·0.6249 ≈ 51.2 meters
    
    The height of the building is approximately 51.2 meters.
