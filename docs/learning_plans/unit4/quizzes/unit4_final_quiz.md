### Part B: Short Answer

11. 2sin²(x) - sin(x) - 1 = 0
    Let u = sin(x)
    2u² - u - 1 = 0
    Using the quadratic formula:
    u = [1 ± √(1 + 8)]/4 = [1 ± 3]/4
    u = 1 or u = -1/2
    sin(x) = 1 → x = 90° or x = 90° + 360n°
    sin(x) = -1/2 → x = 210° or x = 330° (in the range 0° to 360°)
    Solutions: x = 90°, 210°, 330°

12. Using the Sine Law:
    b/sin(B) = a/sin(A)
    b = a·sin(B)/sin(A) = 15·sin(58°)/sin(42°)
    b = 15·0.8480/0.6691 ≈ 19.0 cm

13. Using the Cosine Law:
    cos(P) = (q² + r² - p²)/(2qr)
    cos(P) = (15² + 20² - 12²)/(2·15·20)
    cos(P) = (225 + 400 - 144)/(600)
    cos(P) = 481/600 ≈ 0.8017
    P = cos⁻¹(0.8017) ≈ 36.7°

14. Force 1: F₁x = 120·cos(40°) = 120·0.7660 ≈ 91.9 N
    Force 1: F₁y = 120·sin(40°) = 120·0.6428 ≈ 77.1 N
    Force 2: F₂x = 150·cos(130°) = 150·(-0.7660) ≈ -114.9 N
    Force 2: F₂y = 150·sin(130°) = 150·0.7660 ≈ 114.9 N
    Resultant x-component: Rx = 91.9 + (-114.9) = -23.0 N
    Resultant y-component: Ry = 77.1 + 114.9 = 192.0 N
    Resultant magnitude: R = √((-23.0)² + 192.0²) ≈ 193.5 N
    Resultant direction: θ = tan⁻¹(192.0/(-23.0)) ≈ 96.8° (or 97° measured from the positive x-axis)

15. Direction vector of first line: v₁ = (3, 4, 0)
    Direction vector of second line: v₂ = (2, 0, 2)
    Dot product: v₁·v₂ = 3×2 + 4×0 + 0×2 = 6
    Magnitudes: |v₁| = √(3² + 4² + 0²) = 5, |v₂| = √(2² + 0² + 2²) = 2√2 ≈ 2.83
    Angle: cos(θ) = 6/(5×2.83) ≈ 6/14.15 ≈ 0.424
    θ = cos⁻¹(0.424) ≈ 64.9°

### Part C: Problem Solving

16. Boat velocity components:
    North component = 15·cos(40°) = 15·0.7660 ≈ 11.49 km/h
    East component = 15·sin(40°) = 15·0.6428 ≈ 9.64 km/h
    
    Current velocity components:
    North component = 6·cos(120°) = 6·(-0.5) = -3 km/h
    East component = 6·sin(120°) = 6·0.866 ≈ 5.2 km/h
    
    Resultant velocity components:
    North component = 11.49 + (-3) = 8.49 km/h
    East component = 9.64 + 5.2 = 14.84 km/h
    
    Resultant speed:
    R = √(8.49² + 14.84²) ≈ 17.1 km/h
    
    Resultant direction:
    θ = tan⁻¹(14.84/8.49) ≈ 60.2° east of north
    
    The boat's actual speed is 17.1 km/h in a direction 60.2° east of north.

17. Let h be the height of the tower.
    From the first position:
    tan(28°) = h/60
    h = 60·tan(28°) = 60·0.5317 = 31.9 meters
    
    From the second position:
    tan(18°) = h/100
    h = 100·tan(18°) = 100·0.3249 = 32.5 meters
    
    The slight difference is due to rounding. Taking the average:
    h ≈ 32.2 meters
    
    The height of the tower is approximately 32.2 meters.

18. a) Perimeter = 6 × 8 = 48 cm
    
    b) For a regular hexagon with side length s:
       Area = (3√3/2) × s² = (3√3/2) × 8² = 166.3 cm²
    
    c) For a regular hexagon with side length s:
       Radius of inscribed circle = (s/2) × cot(π/6) = 4 × cot(30°) = 4 × 1.732 = 6.93 cm
    
    d) For a regular hexagon with side length s:
       Radius of circumscribed circle = s/sin(π/3) = 8/sin(60°) = 8/0.866 = 9.24 cm

19. First leg (A to B):
    East component = 250·cos(90° - 70°) = 250·cos(20°) = 250·0.9397 = 234.9 km
    North component = 250·sin(90° - 70°) = 250·sin(20°) = 250·0.3420 = 85.5 km
    
    Second leg (B to C):
    East component = 300·cos(180° - 160°) = 300·cos(20°) = 300·0.9397 = 281.9 km
    North component = 300·sin(180° - 160°) = -300·sin(20°) = -300·0.3420 = -102.6 km
    
    Total displacement:
    East component = 234.9 + 281.9 = 516.8 km
    North component = 85.5 + (-102.6) = -17.1 km
    
    Distance from A to C:
    d = √(516.8² + (-17.1)²) ≈ 517.1 km
    
    Bearing from A to C:
    θ = tan⁻¹(516.8/(-17.1)) = 90° + tan⁻¹(516.8/17.1) ≈ 88.1°
    
    Airport C is approximately 517.1 km from airport A at a bearing of 88.1°.

20. Let h₁ be the height of the hill and h₂ be the height of the tower.
    
    From the first angle of elevation:
    tan(15°) = h₁/500
    h₁ = 500·tan(15°) = 500·0.2680 = 134 meters
    
    From the second angle of elevation:
    tan(22°) = (h₁ + h₂)/500
    h₁ + h₂ = 500·tan(22°) = 500·0.4040 = 202 meters
    
    Therefore:
    h₂ = 202 - 134 = 68 meters
    
    The height of the tower is 68 meters.
