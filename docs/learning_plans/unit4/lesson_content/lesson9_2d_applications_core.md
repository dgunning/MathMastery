## What You're Teaching

This guide helps you teach your teenager how to apply trigonometric concepts to solve real-world two-dimensional problems. Building on the foundation of the Sine Law and Cosine Law, this lesson focuses on practical applications that demonstrate the power and relevance of trigonometry.

## Key Concepts to Cover

### 1. Review of Trigonometric Tools

**Simple explanation:** "Before diving into applications, let's review the key trigonometric tools we've learned that will help us solve real-world problems."

**Key review points:**
- Right triangle trigonometry (SOH-CAH-TOA)
- The Sine Law: a/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C)
- The Cosine Law: a² = b² + c² - 2bc·cos(A)
- When to use each:
  - Right triangle trig: For right triangles
  - Sine Law: For AAS, ASA, or SSA cases
  - Cosine Law: For SSS or SAS cases

### 2. Surveying and Navigation

**Simple explanation:** "Trigonometry is essential in surveying and navigation for determining distances and positions that cannot be measured directly."

**Key applications:**

1. **Finding inaccessible distances:**

**Example 1:**
"A surveyor needs to find the distance across a river. From point A, they walk 50 meters to point B along the riverbank. They measure the angle to a tree on the opposite bank as 75° from point A and 45° from point B. How wide is the river at point A?

Solution:
1. Let's call the tree point C
2. In triangle ABC, we know:
   - Side AB = 50 m
   - Angle at A = 75°
   - Angle at B = 45°
3. Find angle C: C = 180° - 75° - 45° = 60°
4. Use the Sine Law to find AC (the width of the river):
   - AC/sin(B) = AB/sin(C)
   - AC = AB × sin(B)/sin(C) = 50 × sin(45°)/sin(60°)
   - AC = 50 × 0.7071/0.866 ≈ 40.8 meters
5. The river is approximately 40.8 meters wide at point A."

2. **Triangulation:**

**Example 2:**
"Two fire lookout towers A and B are 8 km apart along an east-west line. Tower A spots a fire at a bearing of 65° east of north. Tower B spots the same fire at a bearing of 305° (or 35° west of north). How far is the fire from each tower?

Solution:
1. Let's call the fire point F
2. In triangle ABF:
   - Side AB = 8 km
   - Angle FAB = 65°
   - Angle FBA = 35°
3. Find angle AFB: AFB = 180° - 65° - 35° = 80°
4. Use the Sine Law to find distances:
   - AF/sin(FBA) = AB/sin(AFB)
   - AF = AB × sin(FBA)/sin(AFB) = 8 × sin(35°)/sin(80°)
   - AF = 8 × 0.5736/0.9848 ≈ 4.7 km
   - Similarly, BF = AB × sin(FAB)/sin(AFB) = 8 × sin(65°)/sin(80°)
   - BF = 8 × 0.9063/0.9848 ≈ 7.4 km
5. The fire is approximately 4.7 km from tower A and 7.4 km from tower B."

### 3. Vector Applications

**Simple explanation:** "Vectors represent quantities with both magnitude and direction. Trigonometry helps us analyze and combine vectors in fields like physics and engineering."

**Key applications:**

1. **Vector components:**

**Example 3:**
"A force of 200 N acts at an angle of 35° above the horizontal. Find the horizontal and vertical components of this force.

Solution:
1. Horizontal component = F × cos(θ) = 200 × cos(35°) = 200 × 0.8192 ≈ 163.8 N
2. Vertical component = F × sin(θ) = 200 × sin(35°) = 200 × 0.5736 ≈ 114.7 N
3. The force has a horizontal component of 163.8 N and a vertical component of 114.7 N."

2. **Vector addition:**

**Example 4:**
"A boat is traveling at 12 km/h in a direction of 30° east of north. The current is flowing at 5 km/h in a direction of 110° east of north. Find the resultant speed and direction of the boat.

Solution:
1. Convert to components:
   - Boat: North component = 12 × cos(30°) = 12 × 0.866 ≈ 10.4 km/h
   - Boat: East component = 12 × sin(30°) = 12 × 0.5 = 6 km/h
   - Current: North component = 5 × cos(110°) = 5 × (-0.342) ≈ -1.7 km/h
   - Current: East component = 5 × sin(110°) = 5 × 0.94 ≈ 4.7 km/h
2. Add components:
   - Resultant North component = 10.4 + (-1.7) = 8.7 km/h
   - Resultant East component = 6 + 4.7 = 10.7 km/h
3. Find resultant magnitude:
   - R = √(8.7² + 10.7²) ≈ 13.8 km/h
4. Find resultant direction:
   - θ = tan⁻¹(10.7/8.7) ≈ 50.9° east of north
5. The boat's actual speed is 13.8 km/h in a direction 50.9° east of north."

### 4. Area Calculations

**Simple explanation:** "Trigonometry provides powerful formulas for calculating the areas of triangles and other polygons."

**Key formulas:**

1. **Triangle area using two sides and the included angle:**
   Area = (1/2) × a × b × sin(C)

2. **Triangle area using the semi-perimeter formula (Heron's formula):**
   Area = √(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)), where s = (a+b+c)/2

3. **Regular polygon area:**
   Area = (1/2) × n × r² × sin(360°/n), where n is the number of sides and r is the distance from the center to any vertex

**Example 5:**
"Find the area of a triangle with sides 8 cm, 12 cm, and an included angle of 55°.

Solution:
1. Using the formula Area = (1/2) × a × b × sin(C):
   - Area = (1/2) × 8 × 12 × sin(55°)
   - Area = 48 × 0.8192 ≈ 39.3 cm²
2. The area of the triangle is approximately 39.3 square centimeters."

**Example 6:**
"Find the area of a triangle with sides 5 cm, 7 cm, and 9 cm.

Solution:
1. Using Heron's formula:
   - s = (5 + 7 + 9)/2 = 10.5
   - Area = √(10.5 × (10.5-5) × (10.5-7) × (10.5-9))
   - Area = √(10.5 × 5.5 × 3.5 × 1.5)
   - Area = √(303.2) ≈ 17.4 cm²
2. The area of the triangle is approximately 17.4 square centimeters."

### 5. Physics Applications

**Simple explanation:** "Trigonometry is fundamental in physics for analyzing forces, motion, waves, and many other phenomena."

**Key applications:**

1. **Inclined plane problems:**

**Example 7:**
"A 50 kg crate rests on a frictionless inclined plane that makes an angle of 25° with the horizontal. Find the force needed to keep the crate from sliding down the plane.

Solution:
1. The force of gravity on the crate is mg = 50 × 9.8 = 490 N (downward)
2. The component of gravity parallel to the incline is mg × sin(θ) = 490 × sin(25°) = 490 × 0.4226 ≈ 207.1 N
3. To keep the crate from sliding, we need a force of 207.1 N up the incline."

2. **Projectile motion:**

**Example 8:**
"A ball is thrown with an initial velocity of 20 m/s at an angle of 40° above the horizontal. Find the maximum height reached by the ball and its horizontal range.

Solution:
1. Initial vertical velocity: v₀y = v₀ × sin(θ) = 20 × sin(40°) = 20 × 0.6428 ≈ 12.86 m/s
2. Initial horizontal velocity: v₀x = v₀ × cos(θ) = 20 × cos(40°) = 20 × 0.7660 ≈ 15.32 m/s
3. Maximum height: h = (v₀y)²/(2g) = (12.86)²/(2 × 9.8) ≈ 8.4 m
4. Time to reach maximum height: t₁ = v₀y/g = 12.86/9.8 ≈ 1.31 s
5. Total time of flight: t = 2 × t₁ = 2.62 s
6. Horizontal range: R = v₀x × t = 15.32 × 2.62 ≈ 40.1 m
7. The ball reaches a maximum height of 8.4 meters and travels a horizontal distance of 40.1 meters."

### 6. Engineering Applications

**Simple explanation:** "Engineers use trigonometry extensively in designing structures, analyzing forces, and solving various technical problems."

**Key applications:**

1. **Truss analysis:**

**Example 9:**
"A simple truss has a horizontal span of 8 meters and a height of 3 meters. Find the length of the diagonal member and the angles it makes with the horizontal and vertical members.

Solution:
1. The diagonal member forms a right triangle with the horizontal and vertical members
2. Length of diagonal = √(8² + 3²) = √(73) ≈ 8.54 meters
3. Angle with horizontal: θ₁ = tan⁻¹(3/8) ≈ 20.6°
4. Angle with vertical: θ₂ = 90° - θ₁ = 69.4°
5. The diagonal member is 8.54 meters long and makes angles of 20.6° with the horizontal and 69.4° with the vertical."

2. **Electrical engineering:**

**Example 10:**
"In an AC circuit, the voltage is given by V = 120 × sin(60πt), where t is time in seconds. Find the maximum voltage, frequency, and period of this voltage.

Solution:
1. Maximum voltage (amplitude) = 120 volts
2. Angular frequency ω = 60π radians/second
3. Frequency f = ω/(2π) = 60π/(2π) = 30 Hz
4. Period T = 1/f = 1/30 ≈ 0.033 seconds
5. The voltage has a maximum value of 120 volts, a frequency of 30 Hz, and a period of 0.033 seconds."

### 7. Astronomy and Navigation

**Simple explanation:** "Trigonometry has been used for centuries in astronomy and navigation to determine positions, distances, and directions."

**Key applications:**

1. **Finding heights using shadows:**

**Example 11:**
"At a certain time of day, a 6-foot tall person casts a shadow 8 feet long. How tall is a nearby building that casts a shadow 120 feet long at the same time?

Solution:
1. The angle of elevation of the sun is the same for both the person and the building
2. For the person: tan(θ) = 6/8 = 0.75
3. For the building: h/120 = 0.75, where h is the height of the building
4. Solving for h: h = 120 × 0.75 = 90 feet
5. The building is 90 feet tall."

2. **Celestial navigation:**

**Example 12:**
"A ship is at latitude 40°N. The navigator measures the angle of elevation of the North Star (Polaris) as 38°. How far south of the intended latitude is the ship?

Solution:
1. The angle of elevation of Polaris is approximately equal to the observer's latitude
2. Current latitude = 38°N
3. Intended latitude = 40°N
4. Difference = 40° - 38° = 2°
5. The ship is 2° south of its intended latitude, which is approximately 138 miles (since 1° of latitude is about 69 miles)."

### 8. Combining Multiple Concepts

**Simple explanation:** "Many real-world problems require combining multiple trigonometric concepts and formulas."

**Example 13:**
"A pilot flies from airport A to airport B, which is 300 km away on a bearing of 65°. The pilot then flies to airport C, which is 250 km from B on a bearing of 155°. How far is airport C from airport A, and what is the bearing from A to C?

Solution:
1. Convert to components:
   - AB: East component = 300 × cos(90° - 65°) = 300 × cos(25°) = 300 × 0.9063 ≈ 271.9 km
   - AB: North component = 300 × sin(90° - 65°) = 300 × sin(25°) = 300 × 0.4226 ≈ 126.8 km
   - BC: East component = 250 × cos(180° - 155°) = 250 × cos(25°) = 250 × 0.9063 ≈ 226.6 km
   - BC: North component = 250 × sin(180° - 155°) = -250 × sin(25°) = -250 × 0.4226 ≈ -105.7 km
2. Find components of AC:
   - AC East component = 271.9 + 226.6 = 498.5 km
   - AC North component = 126.8 + (-105.7) = 21.1 km
3. Find distance AC:
   - AC = √(498.5² + 21.1²) ≈ 499.1 km
