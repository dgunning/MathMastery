# Graphing Sine, Cosine, and Tangent: Parent Teaching Guide (Core Version)

## What You're Teaching

This guide helps you teach your teenager how to graph the three primary trigonometric functions—sine, cosine, and tangent—and understand their key features. These graphs are fundamental to modeling periodic phenomena in mathematics, physics, engineering, and many other fields.

## Key Concepts to Cover

### 1. Review of Trigonometric Functions

**Simple explanation:** "Before we start graphing, let's review what we know about the three primary trigonometric functions and their values."

**Key review points:**
- Sine and cosine have values between -1 and 1 inclusive
- Tangent can have any real value
- Special angles and their values (0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 90°, etc.)
- Behavior in different quadrants (CAST rule)
- Period: sine and cosine complete one full cycle every 360° (or 2π radians)
- Tangent completes one full cycle every 180° (or π radians)

### 2. The Sine Function and Its Graph

**Simple explanation:** "The sine function, y = sin(x), creates a wave-like graph that oscillates between -1 and 1. This pattern repeats every 360° (or 2π radians)."

**Key features of the sine graph:**
- **Domain:** All real numbers
- **Range:** -1 ≤ y ≤ 1
- **Period:** 360° or 2π radians
- **x-intercepts:** x = 0°, 180°, 360°, etc. (or x = 0, π, 2π, etc.)
- **y-intercepts:** y = 0 at x = 0
- **Maximum value:** y = 1 at x = 90°, 450°, etc. (or x = π/2, 5π/2, etc.)
- **Minimum value:** y = -1 at x = 270°, 630°, etc. (or x = 3π/2, 7π/2, etc.)
- **Symmetry:** Odd function (sin(-x) = -sin(x))

**Key points to plot:**
```
x (degrees) | 0   | 30  | 60  | 90  | 120 | 150 | 180 | 210 | 240 | 270 | 300 | 330 | 360
x (radians) | 0   | π/6 | π/3 | π/2 | 2π/3| 5π/6| π   | 7π/6| 4π/3| 3π/2| 5π/3| 11π/6| 2π
sin(x)      | 0   | 0.5 | 0.87| 1   | 0.87| 0.5 | 0   |-0.5 |-0.87| -1  |-0.87|-0.5 | 0
```

**Visual aid description:**
"Draw a coordinate system with the x-axis labeled in both degrees (0° to 360°) and radians (0 to 2π). Plot the key points and connect them with a smooth curve. Highlight the maximum and minimum points, as well as the x-intercepts."

### 3. The Cosine Function and Its Graph

**Simple explanation:** "The cosine function, y = cos(x), also creates a wave-like graph that oscillates between -1 and 1. It has the same shape as the sine graph but is shifted horizontally."

**Key features of the cosine graph:**
- **Domain:** All real numbers
- **Range:** -1 ≤ y ≤ 1
- **Period:** 360° or 2π radians
- **x-intercepts:** x = 90°, 270°, etc. (or x = π/2, 3π/2, etc.)
- **y-intercepts:** y = 1 at x = 0
- **Maximum value:** y = 1 at x = 0°, 360°, etc. (or x = 0, 2π, etc.)
- **Minimum value:** y = -1 at x = 180°, 540°, etc. (or x = π, 3π, etc.)
- **Symmetry:** Even function (cos(-x) = cos(x))

**Key points to plot:**
```
x (degrees) | 0   | 30  | 60  | 90  | 120 | 150 | 180 | 210 | 240 | 270 | 300 | 330 | 360
x (radians) | 0   | π/6 | π/3 | π/2 | 2π/3| 5π/6| π   | 7π/6| 4π/3| 3π/2| 5π/3| 11π/6| 2π
cos(x)      | 1   | 0.87| 0.5 | 0   |-0.5 |-0.87| -1  |-0.87|-0.5 | 0   | 0.5 | 0.87| 1
```

**Visual aid description:**
"Draw a coordinate system similar to the one for sine. Plot the key points and connect them with a smooth curve. Note that the cosine graph looks like the sine graph shifted 90° (or π/2 radians) to the left."

### 4. Relationship Between Sine and Cosine

**Simple explanation:** "The sine and cosine functions are closely related. The cosine graph is the same as the sine graph, but shifted 90° (or π/2 radians) to the left."

**Key relationships:**
- cos(x) = sin(x + 90°) or cos(x) = sin(x + π/2)
- sin(x) = cos(x - 90°) or sin(x) = cos(x - π/2)
- sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1 (Pythagorean identity)

**Visual aid description:**
"Draw the sine and cosine graphs on the same coordinate system using different colors. Highlight the phase shift between them."

### 5. The Tangent Function and Its Graph

**Simple explanation:** "The tangent function, y = tan(x), is defined as sin(x)/cos(x). Its graph looks very different from sine and cosine, with vertical asymptotes where cosine equals zero."

**Key features of the tangent graph:**
- **Domain:** All real numbers except x = 90°, 270°, etc. (or x = π/2, 3π/2, etc.)
- **Range:** All real numbers
- **Period:** 180° or π radians
- **x-intercepts:** x = 0°, 180°, 360°, etc. (or x = 0, π, 2π, etc.)
- **Vertical asymptotes:** x = 90°, 270°, etc. (or x = π/2, 3π/2, etc.)
- **Symmetry:** Odd function (tan(-x) = -tan(x))

**Key points to plot:**
```
x (degrees) | 0   | 30  | 45  | 60  | 89  | 91  | 120 | 135 | 150 | 180
x (radians) | 0   | π/6 | π/4 | π/3 | ~π/2| ~π/2| 2π/3| 3π/4| 5π/6| π
tan(x)      | 0   | 0.58| 1   | 1.73| very| very|-1.73| -1  |-0.58| 0
           |     |     |     |     | large| large|     |     |     |
```

**Visual aid description:**
"Draw a coordinate system for one period of tangent (0° to 180° or 0 to π). Plot the key points and connect them with smooth curves between the asymptotes. Draw dashed vertical lines at the asymptotes."

### 6. Transformations of Trigonometric Functions

**Simple explanation:** "We can transform trigonometric functions just like other functions, by changing their amplitude, period, phase shift, and vertical shift."

**Key transformations:**

1. **Amplitude:** y = A·sin(x) or y = A·cos(x)
   - A is the amplitude (maximum distance from the midline)
   - If A > 0, the graph maintains its orientation
   - If A < 0, the graph is reflected across the x-axis
   - The range becomes -|A| ≤ y ≤ |A|

2. **Period:** y = sin(Bx) or y = cos(Bx)
   - The period becomes 360°/|B| or 2π/|B|
   - If B > 0, the graph maintains its orientation
   - If B < 0, the graph is reflected across the y-axis

3. **Phase Shift:** y = sin(x - C) or y = cos(x - C)
   - The graph shifts horizontally by C units
   - If C > 0, the graph shifts to the right
   - If C < 0, the graph shifts to the left

4. **Vertical Shift:** y = sin(x) + D or y = cos(x) + D
   - The graph shifts vertically by D units
   - If D > 0, the graph shifts upward
   - If D < 0, the graph shifts downward
   - The range becomes -1 + D ≤ y ≤ 1 + D

**Combined form:**
y = A·sin(B(x - C)) + D or y = A·cos(B(x - C)) + D

**Example:**
"For y = 2·sin(3x - π) + 1:
- A = 2, so the amplitude is 2 (range is -2 + 1 ≤ y ≤ 2 + 1, or -1 ≤ y ≤ 3)
- B = 3, so the period is 2π/3
- C = π/3 (solving 3x - π = 3(x - π/3)), so the phase shift is π/3 to the right
- D = 1, so the vertical shift is 1 unit upward"

### 7. Graphing Transformed Trigonometric Functions

**Simple explanation:** "To graph a transformed trigonometric function, we identify the amplitude, period, phase shift, and vertical shift, then adjust our basic graph accordingly."

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Identify A, B, C, and D in the equation y = A·sin(B(x - C)) + D or y = A·cos(B(x - C)) + D
2. Determine the amplitude |A|
3. Calculate the period 2π/|B|
4. Find the phase shift C
5. Note the vertical shift D
6. Sketch the graph using these parameters

**Example:**
"To graph y = 3·cos(2x + π) - 1:
1. Rewrite as y = 3·cos(2(x + π/2)) - 1
2. A = 3, so amplitude is 3
3. B = 2, so period is 2π/2 = π
4. C = -π/2, so phase shift is π/2 to the left
5. D = -1, so vertical shift is 1 unit downward
6. The range is -3 - 1 ≤ y ≤ 3 - 1, or -4 ≤ y ≤ 2"

### 8. Applications of Trigonometric Graphs

**Simple explanation:** "Trigonometric functions are ideal for modeling phenomena that repeat in a regular pattern, such as waves, cycles, and oscillations."

**Common applications:**

1. **Physics:**
   - Simple harmonic motion (pendulums, springs)
   - Wave phenomena (sound, light, water waves)
   - Alternating current in electrical circuits

2. **Engineering:**
   - Signal processing
   - Control systems
   - Vibration analysis

3. **Natural phenomena:**
   - Tides
   - Seasonal temperature variations
   - Biorhythms and natural cycles

4. **Music:**
   - Sound waves and harmonics
   - Musical tone generation

**Example problem:**
"The height h (in meters) of a tidal wave at a certain beach can be modeled by h = 2.5·sin(π/6·t) + 3, where t is the time in hours since midnight.
- The amplitude is 2.5 meters
- The period is 2π/(π/6) = 12 hours (two high tides and two low tides per day)
- The midline is at h = 3 meters
- The maximum height is 2.5 + 3 = 5.5 meters
- The minimum height is -2.5 + 3 = 0.5 meters"

## Common Misconceptions and How to Address Them

1. **"The sine and cosine graphs are the same"**
   - Clarification: "They have the same shape but are shifted horizontally by 90° (or π/2 radians)."

2. **"The amplitude of sin(2x) is 2"**
   - Clarification: "The coefficient of x affects the period, not the amplitude. The amplitude is still 1, but the period is halved."

3. **"Tangent has the same period as sine and cosine"**
   - Clarification: "Tangent has a period of 180° (or π radians), which is half the period of sine and cosine."

4. **"Sine and cosine can have values greater than 1 or less than -1"**
   - Clarification: "The range of sine and cosine is always between -1 and 1, unless there's an amplitude change."

5. **"The graph of y = sin(x - 30°) shifts 30° to the left"**
   - Clarification: "That's correct. The graph shifts in the opposite direction of the sign inside the parentheses."

## Check for Understanding

After covering the material, ask these questions:
1. "What are the key differences between the graphs of sine, cosine, and tangent?"
2. "How does changing the coefficient of x in sin(2x) affect the graph?"
