## What You're Teaching

This guide helps you teach your teenager how to apply trigonometric concepts to three-dimensional problems and provides a comprehensive review of Unit 4: Trigonometric Functions. This final lesson ties together all the concepts learned throughout the unit and extends them to 3D applications.

## Key Concepts to Cover

### 1. Introduction to 3D Trigonometry

**Simple explanation:** "Three-dimensional trigonometry extends the concepts we've learned in 2D to problems involving objects in space. This requires us to work with multiple planes and angles."

**Key concepts:**
- Coordinate systems in 3D (x, y, z axes)
- Distance formula in 3D: d = √(x² + y² + z²)
- Angles between lines and planes
- Direction angles and direction cosines

**Visual aid description:**
"Draw a 3D coordinate system with x, y, and z axes. Show a point P(x, y, z) and illustrate how to find the distance from the origin to point P using the 3D distance formula."

### 2. Angles of Elevation and Depression in 3D

**Simple explanation:** "In 3D problems, we often need to consider angles of elevation or depression from different viewpoints or directions."

**Key concepts:**
- Angle of elevation: angle above the horizontal plane
- Angle of depression: angle below the horizontal plane
- Multiple viewing directions

**Example 1:**
"An observer stands at point A(0, 0, 0) and looks at a point B(30, 40, 20) in 3D space. Find the angle of elevation from the observer to point B.

Solution:
1. The horizontal distance from A to the point directly below B is:
   d_h = √(30² + 40²) = √(900 + 1600) = √2500 = 50 units
2. The vertical distance (height) is 20 units
3. The angle of elevation is:
   θ = tan⁻¹(20/50) = tan⁻¹(0.4) ≈ 21.8°
4. The observer needs to look up at an angle of approximately 21.8° to see point B."

### 3. 3D Distance Problems

**Simple explanation:** "Finding distances in 3D space often involves breaking the problem into components and using the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions."

**Example 2:**
"Find the distance between points P(2, 3, 4) and Q(5, 7, 10).

Solution:
1. Using the 3D distance formula:
   d = √((x₂-x₁)² + (y₂-y₁)² + (z₂-z₁)²)
   d = √((5-2)² + (7-3)² + (10-4)²)
   d = √(9 + 16 + 36)
   d = √61 ≈ 7.81 units
2. The distance between the points is approximately 7.81 units."

### 4. Angles Between Lines in 3D

**Simple explanation:** "In 3D, we can find the angle between two lines using vector methods and the dot product formula."

**Key concepts:**
- Direction vectors
- Dot product: a·b = |a|·|b|·cos(θ)
- Angle formula: cos(θ) = (a·b)/(|a|·|b|)

**Example 3:**
"Find the angle between the lines passing through points P₁(0, 0, 0) and P₂(3, 4, 5) and the line passing through points Q₁(0, 0, 0) and Q₂(2, -1, 2).

Solution:
1. Direction vector of first line: v₁ = (3, 4, 5)
2. Direction vector of second line: v₂ = (2, -1, 2)
3. Dot product: v₁·v₂ = 3×2 + 4×(-1) + 5×2 = 6 - 4 + 10 = 12
4. Magnitudes: |v₁| = √(3² + 4² + 5²) = √50 ≈ 7.07, |v₂| = √(2² + (-1)² + 2²) = √9 = 3
5. Angle: cos(θ) = 12/(7.07×3) ≈ 12/21.21 ≈ 0.5658
6. θ = cos⁻¹(0.5658) ≈ 55.6°
7. The angle between the lines is approximately 55.6°."

### 5. Right Triangles in 3D Space

**Simple explanation:** "Many 3D problems can be solved by identifying right triangles in different planes and applying 2D trigonometric methods."

**Example 4:**
"A 10-meter ladder leans against a vertical wall. The foot of the ladder is 3 meters from the wall. If the ladder makes an angle of 20° with the vertical plane containing the wall, how high up the wall does the ladder reach?

Solution:
1. First, find the distance d from the foot of the ladder to the wall along the direction perpendicular to the wall:
   d = 3 meters
2. The ladder makes an angle of 20° with the vertical plane, so the ladder lies in a plane that makes a 20° angle with the vertical plane
3. The vertical height h that the ladder reaches on the wall can be found using:
   h = 10 × cos(20°) × cos(sin⁻¹(d/(10×cos(20°))))
   h = 10 × 0.9397 × cos(sin⁻¹(3/(10×0.9397)))
   h = 9.397 × cos(sin⁻¹(3/9.397))
   h = 9.397 × cos(sin⁻¹(0.3192))
   h = 9.397 × cos(18.6°)
   h = 9.397 × 0.9487 ≈ 8.91 meters
4. The ladder reaches approximately 8.91 meters up the wall."

### 6. Angles Between Planes

**Simple explanation:** "In 3D geometry, we often need to find the angle between two planes, which can be determined using the normal vectors of the planes."

**Key concepts:**
- Normal vectors to planes
- Angle between planes equals angle between their normal vectors
- Dot product formula for angles

**Example 5:**
"Find the angle between the planes with equations 2x + y - 2z = 3 and x - 3y + z = 5.

Solution:
1. Normal vector to first plane: n₁ = (2, 1, -2)
2. Normal vector to second plane: n₂ = (1, -3, 1)
3. Dot product: n₁·n₂ = 2×1 + 1×(-3) + (-2)×1 = 2 - 3 - 2 = -3
4. Magnitudes: |n₁| = √(2² + 1² + (-2)²) = √9 = 3, |n₂| = √(1² + (-3)² + 1²) = √11 ≈ 3.32
5. Angle: cos(θ) = -3/(3×3.32) ≈ -3/9.96 ≈ -0.3012
6. θ = cos⁻¹(-0.3012) ≈ 107.5°
7. The angle between the planes is approximately 107.5° (or alternatively, 72.5° if we consider the acute angle)."

### 7. Applications in Navigation and Astronomy

**Simple explanation:** "3D trigonometry is essential in navigation and astronomy for determining positions, distances, and directions in three-dimensional space."

**Example 6:**
"A ship is located at coordinates (0, 0, 0) relative to a lighthouse. The ship's radar detects an aircraft at coordinates (8, 6, 5) km. Find the distance from the ship to the aircraft and the angle of elevation from the ship to the aircraft.

Solution:
1. Distance from ship to aircraft:
   d = √(8² + 6² + 5²) = √(64 + 36 + 25) = √125 ≈ 11.18 km
2. Horizontal distance:
   d_h = √(8² + 6²) = √(64 + 36) = √100 = 10 km
3. Angle of elevation:
   θ = tan⁻¹(5/10) = tan⁻¹(0.5) = 26.6°
4. The aircraft is approximately 11.18 km from the ship at an angle of elevation of 26.6°."

**Example 7 (Comprehensive Review Problem):**
"A communications tower is located on top of a hill. From a point A on level ground, the angle of elevation to the top of the hill is 15°, and the angle of elevation to the top of the tower is 22°. If point A is 500 meters from the base of the hill, find the height of the tower.

Solution:
1. Let h₁ be the height of the hill and h₂ be the height of the tower
2. From the first angle of elevation:
   tan(15°) = h₁/500
   h₁ = 500 × tan(15°) = 500 × 0.2680 = 134 meters
3. Let d be the slant distance from point A to the top of the hill:
   d = h₁/sin(15°) = 134/0.2588 = 518 meters
4. From the second angle of elevation:
   sin(22°) = (h₁ + h₂)/d'
   where d' is the slant distance from point A to the top of the tower
5. Using the law of sines in the triangle formed:
   d'/sin(163°) = 500/sin(22° - 15°)
   d' = 500 × sin(163°)/sin(7°) = 500 × 0.2924/0.1219 = 1200 meters
6. Now we can find h₂:
   h₁ + h₂ = d' × sin(22°) = 1200 × 0.3746 = 449.5 meters
   h₂ = 449.5 - 134 = 315.5 meters
7. The height of the tower is approximately 315.5 meters."
