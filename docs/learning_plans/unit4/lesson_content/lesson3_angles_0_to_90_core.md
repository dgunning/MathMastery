# Angles Between 0 and 90 Degrees: Parent Teaching Guide (Core Version)

## What You're Teaching

This guide helps you teach your teenager how to evaluate trigonometric ratios for any acute angle (between 0° and 90°), building on their knowledge of special angles (0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 90°) and using tools like calculators, tables, and technology.

## Key Concepts to Cover

### 1. Review of Special Angles

**Simple explanation:** "We've already learned the exact trigonometric values for special angles (0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 90°). Now we'll explore how to find values for any angle between 0° and 90°."

**Quick reference table:**
```
Angle | sin    | cos    | tan    
------+--------+--------+--------
0°    | 0      | 1      | 0      
30°   | 1/2    | √3/2   | 1/√3   
45°   | √2/2   | √2/2   | 1      
60°   | √3/2   | 1/2    | √3     
90°   | 1      | 0      | undef. 
```

### 2. Using a Scientific Calculator

**Simple explanation:** "For angles that aren't special angles, we typically use a calculator to find the trigonometric values."

**Key steps:**
1. Make sure the calculator is in the correct angle mode (degrees, not radians)
2. For sine: press [sin] then enter the angle
3. For cosine: press [cos] then enter the angle
4. For tangent: press [tan] then enter the angle
5. For reciprocal functions (csc, sec, cot), calculate the primary function first, then take the reciprocal (1/x)

**Example calculation:**
"To find sin(37°):
- Set calculator to degree mode
- Press [sin] [3] [7] [=]
- Result: sin(37°) ≈ 0.6018"

### 3. Patterns and Trends in Trigonometric Values

**Simple explanation:** "As angles increase from 0° to 90°, the trigonometric functions change in predictable ways."

**Key patterns:**
- **Sine:** Increases from 0 at 0° to 1 at 90°
- **Cosine:** Decreases from 1 at 0° to 0 at 90°
- **Tangent:** Increases from 0 at 0°, approaching infinity as the angle approaches 90°
- **Cosecant:** Decreases from infinity at 0° to 1 at 90°
- **Secant:** Increases from 1 at 0°, approaching infinity as the angle approaches 90°
- **Cotangent:** Decreases from infinity at 0° to 0 at 90°

**Visual aid description:**
"Draw a right triangle and observe how the ratios of sides change as the angle increases from nearly 0° to nearly 90°."

### 4. Interpolation Between Known Values

**Simple explanation:** "Sometimes we can estimate trigonometric values by interpolating between known values."

**Example:**
"We know sin(30°) = 0.5 and sin(45°) = 0.7071. To estimate sin(40°):
- 40° is 10° more than 30° and 5° less than 45°
- 40° is 2/3 of the way from 30° to 45°
- The difference between sin(45°) and sin(30°) is 0.7071 - 0.5 = 0.2071
- Approximately 2/3 of this difference is 0.2071 × 2/3 ≈ 0.138
- So sin(40°) ≈ 0.5 + 0.138 = 0.638
- (The actual value is about 0.643, so our estimate is close)"

### 5. Using the Unit Circle

**Simple explanation:** "The unit circle provides a geometric way to understand trigonometric values for any angle."

**Key concepts:**
- For any angle θ, imagine a ray from the origin making that angle with the positive x-axis
- Where this ray intersects the unit circle gives the point (cos(θ), sin(θ))
- As θ increases from 0° to 90°, the point moves from (1,0) to (0,1)

**Example:**
"For θ = 60°:
- The point on the unit circle is (0.5, 0.866)
- Therefore, cos(60°) = 0.5 and sin(60°) = 0.866"

### 6. Solving Right Triangle Problems

**Simple explanation:** "When we know one acute angle and one side of a right triangle, we can find all other parts using trigonometric ratios."

**Problem-solving steps:**
1. Draw and label the right triangle
2. Identify what you know and what you need to find
3. Determine which trigonometric ratio relates these values
4. Solve the equation for the unknown value

**Example problem:**
"A ladder 10 meters long leans against a wall. If the angle between the ladder and the ground is 37°, how high up the wall does the ladder reach?

Solution:
- We know the hypotenuse (10 m) and the angle (37°)
- We need to find the opposite side (height)
- sin(37°) = opposite/hypotenuse = height/10
- height = 10 × sin(37°) = 10 × 0.6018 = 6.018 meters"

### 7. Inverse Trigonometric Functions

**Simple explanation:** "Inverse trigonometric functions let us find an angle when we know the value of a trigonometric ratio."

**Key functions:**
- **sin⁻¹(x)** or **arcsin(x)**: Gives the angle whose sine is x
- **cos⁻¹(x)** or **arccos(x)**: Gives the angle whose cosine is x
- **tan⁻¹(x)** or **arctan(x)**: Gives the angle whose tangent is x

**Example calculation:**
"To find the angle θ if sin(θ) = 0.7:
- Use sin⁻¹(0.7) on a calculator
- Result: θ ≈ 44.4°"

**Domain and range:**
- sin⁻¹(x) is defined for -1 ≤ x ≤ 1 and gives angles between -90° and 90°
- cos⁻¹(x) is defined for -1 ≤ x ≤ 1 and gives angles between 0° and 180°
- tan⁻¹(x) is defined for all real x and gives angles between -90° and 90°

### 8. Applications of Trigonometry for Acute Angles

**Simple explanation:** "Trigonometry with acute angles has many practical applications in real-world situations."

**Common applications:**
1. **Finding heights and distances:**
   - Height of buildings, trees, or mountains
   - Distance across rivers or canyons
   - Depth of wells or holes

2. **Navigation:**
   - Determining position using angles and distances
   - Course correction in aviation and marine navigation

3. **Engineering and construction:**
   - Calculating forces in structures
   - Designing ramps, roofs, and inclines

4. **Surveying:**
   - Measuring land boundaries
   - Creating topographic maps

**Example problem:**
"From a point 50 meters from the base of a tower, the angle of elevation to the top of the tower is 32°. How tall is the tower?

Solution:
- We know the adjacent side (50 m) and the angle (32°)
- We need to find the opposite side (height)
- tan(32°) = opposite/adjacent = height/50
- height = 50 × tan(32°) = 50 × 0.6249 = 31.25 meters"

## Common Misconceptions and How to Address Them

1. **"Trigonometric ratios are only defined for special angles"**
   - Clarification: "Trig ratios are defined for any angle, but we need calculators for most angles."

2. **"Calculators always give exact values"**
   - Clarification: "Calculators give decimal approximations. Only special angles have exact values in simplified radical form."

3. **"Degrees and radians are interchangeable"**
   - Clarification: "Always check if your calculator is in the correct mode (degrees or radians) for your problem."

4. **"Sine and cosine can have any value"**
   - Clarification: "Sine and cosine values are always between -1 and 1 inclusive."

5. **"Tangent behaves like sine and cosine"**
   - Clarification: "Unlike sine and cosine, tangent can have any real value and becomes undefined at 90°."
