# Primary and Reciprocal Trigonometric Ratios: Parent Teaching Guide

## What You're Teaching

This guide helps you teach your teenager about the six fundamental trigonometric ratios: sine, cosine, tangent, cosecant, secant, and cotangent. These ratios form the foundation of trigonometry and are essential for solving problems involving triangles, angles, and periodic phenomena.

## Key Concepts to Cover

### 1. Understanding Right Triangles

**Simple explanation:** "Before we dive into trigonometric ratios, let's make sure we understand the parts of a right triangle. A right triangle has one 90° angle, and the side opposite to this angle is called the hypotenuse. The other two sides are called the adjacent and opposite sides, depending on which angle we're focusing on."

**Key terms:**
- **Right angle:** The 90° angle in a right triangle
- **Hypotenuse:** The longest side of a right triangle, opposite to the right angle
- **Adjacent side:** The side next to the angle we're focusing on (not the hypotenuse)
- **Opposite side:** The side across from the angle we're focusing on (not the hypotenuse)

**Visual aid description:**
"Draw a right triangle and label one of the non-right angles as θ (theta). Then label the sides as:
- Hypotenuse (the longest side, opposite the right angle)
- Adjacent (the side next to angle θ)
- Opposite (the side across from angle θ)"

### 2. Primary Trigonometric Ratios

**Simple explanation:** "The three primary trigonometric ratios—sine, cosine, and tangent—are relationships between the sides of a right triangle based on one of the angles."

**Definitions:**
- **Sine (sin):** The ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse
  - sin(θ) = opposite / hypotenuse
- **Cosine (cos):** The ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse
  - cos(θ) = adjacent / hypotenuse
- **Tangent (tan):** The ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side
  - tan(θ) = opposite / adjacent

**Mnemonic:** "SOH-CAH-TOA" helps remember these ratios:
- **S**ine = **O**pposite / **H**ypotenuse
- **C**osine = **A**djacent / **H**ypotenuse
- **T**angent = **O**pposite / **A**djacent

**Example calculation:**
"In a right triangle with an angle θ = 30°, if the hypotenuse is 10 cm:
- The opposite side = 10 × sin(30°) = 10 × 0.5 = 5 cm
- The adjacent side = 10 × cos(30°) = 10 × 0.866 = 8.66 cm
- We can verify that tan(30°) = opposite/adjacent = 5/8.66 = 0.577"

### 3. Reciprocal Trigonometric Ratios

**Simple explanation:** "The three reciprocal trigonometric ratios—cosecant, secant, and cotangent—are simply the reciprocals (or flipped fractions) of the primary ratios."

**Definitions:**
- **Cosecant (csc):** The reciprocal of sine
  - csc(θ) = 1/sin(θ) = hypotenuse / opposite
- **Secant (sec):** The reciprocal of cosine
  - sec(θ) = 1/cos(θ) = hypotenuse / adjacent
- **Cotangent (cot):** The reciprocal of tangent
  - cot(θ) = 1/tan(θ) = adjacent / opposite

**Mnemonic extension:** Building on SOH-CAH-TOA:
- **C**osecant = **H**ypotenuse / **O**pposite (reciprocal of sine)
- **S**ecant = **H**ypotenuse / **A**djacent (reciprocal of cosine)
- **C**otangent = **A**djacent / **O**pposite (reciprocal of tangent)

**Example calculation:**
"Using the same triangle with θ = 30° and hypotenuse = 10 cm:
- csc(30°) = 1/sin(30°) = 1/0.5 = 2
- sec(30°) = 1/cos(30°) = 1/0.866 = 1.155
- cot(30°) = 1/tan(30°) = 1/0.577 = 1.732"

### 4. Understanding the Unit Circle

**Simple explanation:** "The unit circle is a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin of a coordinate system. It helps us extend trigonometric ratios beyond right triangles to any angle."

**Key concepts:**
- The unit circle has radius 1
- Any point (x, y) on the circle corresponds to an angle θ from the positive x-axis
- For that point: x = cos(θ) and y = sin(θ)
- This gives us a way to define trig ratios for any angle, not just those in right triangles

**Visual aid description:**
"Draw a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin. Draw a line from the origin at angle θ. Where this line intersects the circle, the x-coordinate is cos(θ) and the y-coordinate is sin(θ)."

**Example:**
"For θ = 45°:
- The point on the unit circle is approximately (0.707, 0.707)
- Therefore, cos(45°) = 0.707 and sin(45°) = 0.707
- And tan(45°) = sin(45°)/cos(45°) = 0.707/0.707 = 1"

### 5. Exact Values for Common Angles

**Simple explanation:** "There are certain special angles where we can find the exact values of trigonometric ratios without a calculator."

**Key angles to memorize:**
- 0° (0 radians)
- 30° (π/6 radians)
- 45° (π/4 radians)
- 60° (π/3 radians)
- 90° (π/2 radians)

**Table of values:**
```
Angle | sin    | cos    | tan    | csc    | sec    | cot
------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------
0°    | 0      | 1      | 0      | undef. | 1      | undef.
30°   | 1/2    | √3/2   | 1/√3   | 2      | 2/√3   | √3
45°   | 1/√2   | 1/√2   | 1      | √2     | √2     | 1
60°   | √3/2   | 1/2    | √3     | 2/√3   | 2      | 1/√3
90°   | 1      | 0      | undef. | 1      | undef. | 0
```

**Tip:** "These values come from special right triangles (30-60-90 and 45-45-90) that we'll explore more in the next lesson."

### 6. Relationships Between Trigonometric Ratios

**Simple explanation:** "The six trigonometric ratios are related to each other in several important ways."

**Key relationships:**
- sin(θ) = 1/csc(θ)
- cos(θ) = 1/sec(θ)
- tan(θ) = sin(θ)/cos(θ)
- cot(θ) = cos(θ)/sin(θ) = 1/tan(θ)
- sin²(θ) + cos²(θ) = 1 (Pythagorean identity)
- 1 + tan²(θ) = sec²(θ)
- 1 + cot²(θ) = csc²(θ)

**Example application:**
"If we know that sin(θ) = 0.6, we can find:
- csc(θ) = 1/sin(θ) = 1/0.6 = 5/3
- cos(θ) = √(1 - sin²(θ)) = √(1 - 0.36) = √0.64 = 0.8
- sec(θ) = 1/cos(θ) = 1/0.8 = 5/4
- tan(θ) = sin(θ)/cos(θ) = 0.6/0.8 = 0.75
- cot(θ) = 1/tan(θ) = 1/0.75 = 4/3"

### 7. Applications of Trigonometric Ratios

**Simple explanation:** "Trigonometric ratios have many practical applications in real-world situations involving heights, distances, and angles."

**Common applications:**
1. **Finding heights and distances:**
   - Height of buildings, trees, or mountains
   - Distance across rivers or canyons
   - Depth of wells or holes

2. **Navigation:**
   - Determining position using angles and distances
   - Course correction in aviation and marine navigation

3. **Engineering and construction:**
   - Calculating forces in structures
   - Designing ramps, roofs, and inclines

4. **Physics:**
   - Analyzing motion in two dimensions
   - Understanding waves and oscillations

**Example problem:**
"A ladder 10 meters long leans against a wall. If the ladder makes an angle of 60° with the ground, how high up the wall does the ladder reach?

Solution:
- We need to find the opposite side (height) given the hypotenuse (ladder) and the angle
- Height = hypotenuse × sin(angle)
- Height = 10 × sin(60°) = 10 × 0.866 = 8.66 meters"

## Common Misconceptions and How to Address Them

1. **"Sine, cosine, and tangent are just buttons on a calculator"**
   - Clarification: "These are ratios between sides of triangles that have been studied for thousands of years and have profound mathematical meaning."

2. **"Trigonometric ratios only apply to right triangles"**
   - Clarification: "While they're defined using right triangles, trig ratios extend to any angle through the unit circle and are used in many contexts beyond triangles."

3. **"The reciprocal trig functions (csc, sec, cot) aren't important"**
   - Clarification: "These functions are very useful in calculus and physics, and understanding them now builds a strong foundation for future math."

4. **"Memorizing the values is the most important part"**
   - Clarification: "Understanding the relationships and being able to derive values is more important than memorization."

5. **"Trigonometry isn't used in real life"**
   - Clarification: "Trigonometry is essential in fields like engineering, architecture, navigation, physics, computer graphics, and many others."

## Check for Understanding

## Practice Problems

1. Find the six trigonometric ratios for angle A in a right triangle with sides a = 5, b = 12, and c = 13, where c is the hypotenuse.

2. If sin(θ) = 3/5, find the values of the other five trigonometric ratios.

3. A 15-foot ladder leans against a wall. If the bottom of the ladder is 5 feet from the base of the wall, what angle does the ladder make with the ground?

4. From the top of a 50-meter lighthouse, the angle of depression to a boat is 25°. How far is the boat from the base of the lighthouse?

5. Verify the identity sin²(θ) + cos²(θ) = 1 for θ = 45°.

6. If tan(α) = 4/3, find sin(α) and cos(α).

7. A ramp is built with a 15° incline. If the horizontal distance covered by the ramp is 12 meters, what is the length of the ramp?

8. The minute hand of a clock is 8 cm long. How far does the tip of the minute hand travel in 20 minutes?

**Solutions:**

1. For the triangle with sides a = 5, b = 12, and c = 13:
   - If angle A is opposite side a:
     - sin(A) = opposite/hypotenuse = 5/13
     - cos(A) = adjacent/hypotenuse = 12/13
     - tan(A) = opposite/adjacent = 5/12
     - csc(A) = 13/5
     - sec(A) = 13/12
     - cot(A) = 12/5

2. If sin(θ) = 3/5:
   - cos(θ) = √(1 - sin²(θ)) = √(1 - 9/25) = √(16/25) = 4/5
   - tan(θ) = sin(θ)/cos(θ) = (3/5)/(4/5) = 3/4
   - csc(θ) = 1/sin(θ) = 5/3
   - sec(θ) = 1/cos(θ) = 5/4
   - cot(θ) = 1/tan(θ) = 4/3

3. For the ladder problem:
   - We know the adjacent side (5 feet) and the hypotenuse (15 feet)
   - cos(θ) = adjacent/hypotenuse = 5/15 = 1/3
   - θ = cos⁻¹(1/3) ≈ 70.5°

4. For the lighthouse problem:
   - The angle of depression is 25°, so the angle of elevation from the boat is also 25°
   - We need to find the adjacent side (distance) given the opposite side (height) and the angle
   - tan(25°) = opposite/adjacent = 50/distance
   - distance = 50/tan(25°) = 50/0.466 ≈ 107.3 meters

5. For θ = 45°:
   - sin(45°) = 1/√2 ≈ 0.7071
   - cos(45°) = 1/√2 ≈ 0.7071
   - sin²(45°) + cos²(45°) = (0.7071)² + (0.7071)² = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 ✓

6. If tan(α) = 4/3:
   - We know that tan(α) = sin(α)/cos(α) = 4/3
   - Also, sin²(α) + cos²(α) = 1
   - Let's say sin(α) = 4k and cos(α) = 3k for some value k
   - Then (4k)² + (3k)² = 1
   - 16k² + 9k² = 1
   - 25k² = 1
   - k = 1/5
   - Therefore, sin(α) = 4/5 and cos(α) = 3/5

7. For the ramp problem:
   - We know the adjacent side (12 meters) and the angle (15°)
   - We need to find the hypotenuse (length of the ramp)
   - cos(15°) = adjacent/hypotenuse = 12/length
   - length = 12/cos(15°) = 12/0.9659 ≈ 12.42 meters

8. For the clock problem:
   - The minute hand makes a complete 360° rotation in 60 minutes
   - In 20 minutes, it rotates (20/60) × 360° = 120°
   - The distance traveled is the arc length: s = r × θ (where θ is in radians)
   - θ = 120° × (π/180°) = 2π/3 radians
   - s = 8 × (2π/3) ≈ 16.76 cm
