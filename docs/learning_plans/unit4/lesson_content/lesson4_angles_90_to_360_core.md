# Angles Between 90 and 360 Degrees: Parent Teaching Guide (Core Version)

## What You're Teaching

This guide helps you teach your teenager how to extend trigonometric ratios beyond acute angles to include angles from 90° to 360°. This is a crucial step in understanding the full behavior of trigonometric functions and their applications in various fields.

## Key Concepts to Cover

### 1. Review of Acute Angle Trigonometry

**Simple explanation:** "So far, we've defined trigonometric ratios for angles between 0° and 90° using right triangles. Now we'll extend these definitions to angles of any size."

**Key review points:**
- The six trigonometric ratios: sine, cosine, tangent, cosecant, secant, cotangent
- Special angles and their values (0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 90°)
- Right triangle definitions only work directly for acute angles (0° to 90°)

### 2. The Unit Circle Approach

**Simple explanation:** "The unit circle is a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin of a coordinate system. It allows us to define trigonometric functions for any angle, not just those in right triangles."

**Key concepts:**
- The unit circle has radius 1
- Any point (x, y) on the circle corresponds to an angle θ from the positive x-axis
- For that point: x = cos(θ) and y = sin(θ)
- Angles are measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis
- Negative angles are measured clockwise from the positive x-axis

**Visual aid description:**
"Draw a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin. Mark the four quadrants. Draw a line from the origin at various angles (including angles > 90°). Where this line intersects the circle, the x-coordinate is cos(θ) and the y-coordinate is sin(θ)."

### 3. Understanding Quadrants

**Simple explanation:** "The coordinate plane is divided into four quadrants, numbered counterclockwise from the upper right. The signs of the trigonometric functions depend on which quadrant the angle is in."

**Quadrant characteristics:**
- **Quadrant I (0° to 90°):** Both x and y are positive
  - All trig functions are positive
- **Quadrant II (90° to 180°):** x is negative, y is positive
  - Only sine and cosecant are positive
- **Quadrant III (180° to 270°):** Both x and y are negative
  - Only tangent and cotangent are positive
- **Quadrant IV (270° to 360°):** x is positive, y is negative
  - Only cosine and secant are positive

**Mnemonic:** "All Students Take Calculus"
- **A**ll functions are positive in Quadrant I
- **S**ine and cosecant are positive in Quadrant II
- **T**angent and cotangent are positive in Quadrant III
- **C**osine and secant are positive in Quadrant IV

### 4. The CAST Rule

**Simple explanation:** "The CAST rule is a helpful mnemonic for remembering which trigonometric functions are positive in each quadrant."

**CAST explanation:**
- **C**: Cosine and secant are positive in Quadrant IV (Cast)
- **A**: All functions are positive in Quadrant I (All)
- **S**: Sine and cosecant are positive in Quadrant II (Sin)
- **T**: Tangent and cotangent are positive in Quadrant III (Tan)

**Visual aid description:**
"Draw the unit circle and label the quadrants with the letters C, A, S, T in clockwise order starting from Quadrant IV."

### 5. Reference Angles

**Simple explanation:** "A reference angle is the acute angle (between 0° and 90°) that an angle in any quadrant makes with the x-axis. It helps us find trigonometric values for any angle using our knowledge of acute angles."

**How to find the reference angle:**
- For angles in Quadrant I (0° to 90°): The reference angle is the angle itself
- For angles in Quadrant II (90° to 180°): Reference angle = 180° - θ
- For angles in Quadrant III (180° to 270°): Reference angle = θ - 180°
- For angles in Quadrant IV (270° to 360°): Reference angle = 360° - θ

**Example:**
"For θ = 135°:
- This is in Quadrant II
- Reference angle = 180° - 135° = 45°
- So the reference angle is 45°"

### 6. Finding Trigonometric Values Using Reference Angles

**Simple explanation:** "To find the trigonometric value of any angle, find its reference angle, determine the value for that reference angle, and then apply the appropriate sign based on the quadrant."

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Identify the quadrant in which the angle lies
2. Find the reference angle
3. Find the trigonometric value for the reference angle
4. Apply the appropriate sign based on the quadrant

**Example calculation:**
"To find sin(135°):
1. 135° is in Quadrant II
2. Reference angle = 180° - 135° = 45°
3. sin(45°) = √2/2
4. In Quadrant II, sine is positive
5. Therefore, sin(135°) = √2/2 ≈ 0.7071"

**Another example:**
"To find cos(225°):
1. 225° is in Quadrant III
2. Reference angle = 225° - 180° = 45°
3. cos(45°) = √2/2
4. In Quadrant III, cosine is negative
5. Therefore, cos(225°) = -√2/2 ≈ -0.7071"

### 7. Special Angles in All Quadrants

**Simple explanation:** "We can extend our knowledge of special angles (30°, 45°, 60°) to find exact values for related angles in all quadrants."

**Examples of related angles:**
- 30°, 150°, 210°, 330° (all have reference angle 30°)
- 45°, 135°, 225°, 315° (all have reference angle 45°)
- 60°, 120°, 240°, 300° (all have reference angle 60°)

**Table for sine and cosine:**
```
Angle   | Reference | sin     | cos
--------+-----------+---------+--------
0°      | 0°        | 0       | 1
30°     | 30°       | 1/2     | √3/2
45°     | 45°       | √2/2    | √2/2
60°     | 60°       | √3/2    | 1/2
90°     | 90°       | 1       | 0
120°    | 60°       | √3/2    | -1/2
135°    | 45°       | √2/2    | -√2/2
150°    | 30°       | 1/2     | -√3/2
180°    | 0°        | 0       | -1
210°    | 30°       | -1/2    | -√3/2
225°    | 45°       | -√2/2   | -√2/2
240°    | 60°       | -√3/2   | -1/2
270°    | 90°       | -1      | 0
300°    | 60°       | -√3/2   | 1/2
315°    | 45°       | -√2/2   | √2/2
330°    | 30°       | -1/2    | √3/2
360°    | 0°        | 0       | 1
```

### 8. Coterminal Angles

**Simple explanation:** "Coterminal angles are different angles that have the same terminal side. They differ by multiples of 360° (or 2π radians)."

**Key properties:**
- Angles θ and θ ± 360°n (where n is any integer) are coterminal
- Coterminal angles have identical trigonometric values
- The smallest positive coterminal angle is between 0° and 360°

**Examples:**
- 45° and 405° (= 45° + 360°) are coterminal
- -30° and 330° (= -30° + 360°) are coterminal
- 540° and 180° (= 540° - 360°) are coterminal

**Application:**
"To find the smallest positive coterminal angle for -45°:
- Add 360°: -45° + 360° = 315°
- Since 315° is between 0° and 360°, it's the smallest positive coterminal angle"

### 9. Negative Angles

**Simple explanation:** "Negative angles are measured clockwise from the positive x-axis, while positive angles are measured counterclockwise."

**Key relationships:**
- sin(-θ) = -sin(θ) (sine is an odd function)
- cos(-θ) = cos(θ) (cosine is an even function)
- tan(-θ) = -tan(θ) (tangent is an odd function)

**Example:**
"To find cos(-60°):
- Since cosine is an even function, cos(-60°) = cos(60°) = 1/2
- To find sin(-60°):
- Since sine is an odd function, sin(-60°) = -sin(60°) = -√3/2"

### 10. Applications of Extended Angle Trigonometry

**Simple explanation:** "Understanding trigonometry for all angles is essential for modeling periodic phenomena and solving real-world problems."

**Common applications:**
1. **Circular motion:**
   - Describing the position of objects moving in circles
   - Modeling wheels, gears, and rotating machinery

2. **Wave phenomena:**
   - Sound waves, light waves, water waves
   - Alternating current in electrical circuits

3. **Navigation:**
   - Compass bearings and directions
   - Flight paths and ship courses

4. **Astronomy:**
   - Planetary orbits
   - Celestial navigation

**Example problem:**
"A Ferris wheel with radius 20 meters rotates counterclockwise at a constant rate, making one complete revolution every 60 seconds. If a passenger starts at the rightmost point (3 o'clock position):
- After 15 seconds, they've rotated 90° and are at the top
- Their horizontal position is x = 20 × cos(90°) = 0 meters
- Their vertical position is y = 20 × sin(90°) = 20 meters
- After 30 seconds, they've rotated 180° and are at the leftmost point
- Their horizontal position is x = 20 × cos(180°) = -20 meters
- Their vertical position is y = 20 × sin(180°) = 0 meters"

## Common Misconceptions and How to Address Them

1. **"Trigonometric functions are only defined for angles in right triangles"**
   - Clarification: "While they're initially defined using right triangles, trig functions extend to any angle through the unit circle definition."

2. **"Sine and cosine can have values greater than 1 or less than -1"**
   - Clarification: "Sine and cosine values are always between -1 and 1 inclusive, regardless of the angle."

3. **"The signs of trigonometric functions are random for different angles"**
   - Clarification: "The signs follow a clear pattern based on the quadrant, which we can remember using the CAST rule."

4. **"Reference angles are complicated to find"**
   - Clarification: "Reference angles are simply the acute angle between the terminal side of the angle and the x-axis."

5. **"Negative angles don't have trigonometric values"**
   - Clarification: "Negative angles are perfectly valid and represent clockwise rotation instead of counterclockwise."
