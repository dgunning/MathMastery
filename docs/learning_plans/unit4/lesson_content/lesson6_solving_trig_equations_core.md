# Solving Trigonometric Equations: Parent Teaching Guide (Core Version)

## What You're Teaching

This guide helps you teach your teenager how to solve trigonometric equations—equations that involve trigonometric functions like sine, cosine, and tangent. These equations are essential for analyzing periodic phenomena and have applications in physics, engineering, and many other fields.

## Key Concepts to Cover

### 1. Review of Trigonometric Functions and Their Graphs

**Simple explanation:** "Before we solve trigonometric equations, let's review what we know about the three primary trigonometric functions and their key properties."

**Key review points:**
- Sine and cosine have values between -1 and 1 inclusive
- Tangent can have any real value
- Period: sine and cosine complete one full cycle every 360° (or 2π radians)
- Tangent completes one full cycle every 180° (or π radians)
- Key angles and their exact values (0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 90°, etc.)
- Behavior in different quadrants (CAST rule)

### 2. Understanding Trigonometric Equations

**Simple explanation:** "A trigonometric equation is an equation that involves one or more trigonometric functions. Solving these equations means finding all values of the variable that make the equation true."

**Types of trigonometric equations:**
1. **Basic equations:** Directly finding angles for a given trigonometric value
   - Example: sin(x) = 0.5
   
2. **Linear trigonometric equations:** Equations in the form a·sin(x) + b = c
   - Example: 2·sin(x) - 1 = 0
   
3. **Quadratic-type equations:** Equations that can be rewritten in quadratic form
   - Example: sin²(x) - sin(x) = 0
   
4. **Multiple angle equations:** Equations involving multiple angles
   - Example: sin(2x) = cos(x)
   
5. **Equations with multiple trigonometric functions:**
   - Example: sin(x) + cos(x) = 1

**Important concept:**
"Unlike regular equations that might have one or a few solutions, trigonometric equations typically have infinitely many solutions due to the periodic nature of trigonometric functions."

### 3. Finding Principal Solutions and General Solutions

**Simple explanation:** "When solving trigonometric equations, we typically find the 'principal solutions' first (solutions in a specific interval), then extend to the 'general solution' (all possible solutions)."

**Key terms:**
- **Principal solutions:** Solutions within a specified interval, usually [0°, 360°) or [0, 2π)
- **General solution:** The complete set of all solutions, expressed using a formula with an integer parameter

**Example:**
"For sin(x) = 0.5:
- Principal solutions in [0°, 360°): x = 30° and x = 150°
- General solution: x = 30° + 360°n or x = 150° + 360°n, where n is any integer"

### 4. Solving Basic Trigonometric Equations

**Simple explanation:** "The simplest trigonometric equations involve finding angles for a given trigonometric value."

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Isolate the trigonometric function
2. Find the principal solutions using the inverse trigonometric function
3. Find additional solutions within the desired interval using symmetry and periodicity
4. Express the general solution

**Example 1:**
"Solve sin(x) = 0.5 for all values of x.

1. The trigonometric function is already isolated
2. Principal solution: x = sin⁻¹(0.5) = 30°
3. Since sine is positive in Quadrants I and II, and sin(180° - 30°) = sin(30°):
   - Additional solution in [0°, 360°): x = 180° - 30° = 150°
4. General solution: x = 30° + 360°n or x = 150° + 360°n, where n is any integer"

**Example 2:**
"Solve cos(x) = -0.5 for all values of x.

1. The trigonometric function is already isolated
2. Principal solution: x = cos⁻¹(-0.5) = 120°
3. Since cosine is negative in Quadrants II and III, and cos(360° - 120°) = cos(120°):
   - Additional solution in [0°, 360°): x = 360° - 120° = 240°
4. General solution: x = 120° + 360°n or x = 240° + 360°n, where n is any integer"

**Example 3:**
"Solve tan(x) = 1 for all values of x.

1. The trigonometric function is already isolated
2. Principal solution: x = tan⁻¹(1) = 45°
3. Since tangent has period 180°:
   - Additional solution in [0°, 360°): x = 45° + 180° = 225°
4. General solution: x = 45° + 180°n, where n is any integer"

### 5. Solving Linear Trigonometric Equations

**Simple explanation:** "Linear trigonometric equations involve a trigonometric function multiplied by a coefficient, plus possibly a constant."

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Rearrange to isolate the trigonometric function
2. Solve as a basic trigonometric equation
3. Find all solutions in the desired interval
4. Express the general solution

**Example:**
"Solve 2·sin(x) - 1 = 0 for all values of x.

1. Rearrange: 2·sin(x) = 1, so sin(x) = 0.5
2. Principal solution: x = sin⁻¹(0.5) = 30°
3. Additional solution in [0°, 360°): x = 180° - 30° = 150°
4. General solution: x = 30° + 360°n or x = 150° + 360°n, where n is any integer"

### 6. Solving Quadratic-Type Trigonometric Equations

**Simple explanation:** "Some trigonometric equations can be rewritten in a quadratic form, which we can solve using factoring, the quadratic formula, or other algebraic techniques."

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Rearrange the equation into a standard form
2. Treat the trigonometric function as a variable and solve the resulting quadratic equation
3. Solve each resulting basic trigonometric equation
4. Find all solutions in the desired interval
5. Express the general solution

**Example 1:**
"Solve sin²(x) - sin(x) = 0 for all values of x in [0°, 360°).

1. Factor: sin(x)(sin(x) - 1) = 0
2. This gives us two equations:
   - sin(x) = 0
   - sin(x) = 1
3. Solving sin(x) = 0:
   - x = 0° or x = 180°
4. Solving sin(x) = 1:
   - x = 90°
5. Solutions in [0°, 360°): x = 0°, x = 90°, x = 180°"

**Example 2:**
"Solve 2·cos²(x) + cos(x) - 1 = 0 for all values of x in [0°, 360°).

1. Treat cos(x) as a variable, let u = cos(x):
   - 2u² + u - 1 = 0
2. Solve using the quadratic formula:
   - u = (-1 ± √(1 + 8))/4 = (-1 ± 3)/4
   - u = 1/2 or u = -1
3. So cos(x) = 1/2 or cos(x) = -1
4. Solving cos(x) = 1/2:
   - x = 60° or x = 300°
5. Solving cos(x) = -1:
   - x = 180°
6. Solutions in [0°, 360°): x = 60°, x = 180°, x = 300°"

### 7. Solving Equations with Multiple Angles

**Simple explanation:** "Some trigonometric equations involve multiple angles, such as sin(2x) or cos(3x). We need to use identities or substitution to solve these."

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Use appropriate identities if needed
2. Solve for the multiple angle first
3. Divide by the multiplier to find the original angle
4. Adjust the general solution to account for the period

**Example:**
"Solve sin(2x) = 0.5 for all values of x in [0°, 180°).

1. First, solve for 2x:
   - 2x = 30° + 360°n or 2x = 150° + 360°n
2. Divide by 2 to find x:
   - x = 15° + 180°n or x = 75° + 180°n
3. Solutions in [0°, 180°): x = 15°, x = 75°, x = 165°"

### 8. Solving Equations with Multiple Trigonometric Functions

**Simple explanation:** "Some equations involve more than one type of trigonometric function. We often need to use identities to rewrite these in terms of a single function."

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Use trigonometric identities to simplify or convert to a single function
2. Solve the resulting equation
3. Check all solutions (important because some identities might introduce extraneous solutions)

**Example 1:**
"Solve sin(x) + cos(x) = 1 for all values of x in [0°, 360°).

1. Square both sides: (sin(x) + cos(x))² = 1²
2. Expand: sin²(x) + 2·sin(x)·cos(x) + cos²(x) = 1
3. Use the identity sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1:
   - 1 + 2·sin(x)·cos(x) = 1
   - 2·sin(x)·cos(x) = 0
   - sin(x)·cos(x) = 0
4. This means either sin(x) = 0 or cos(x) = 0
5. Solving sin(x) = 0: x = 0° or x = 180°
6. Solving cos(x) = 0: x = 90° or x = 270°
7. Check each solution in the original equation:
   - sin(0°) + cos(0°) = 0 + 1 = 1 ✓
   - sin(90°) + cos(90°) = 1 + 0 = 1 ✓
   - sin(180°) + cos(180°) = 0 + (-1) = -1 ✗
   - sin(270°) + cos(270°) = -1 + 0 = -1 ✗
8. Solutions in [0°, 360°): x = 0°, x = 90°"

**Example 2:**
"Solve sin(x) = cos(x) for all values of x in [0°, 360°).

1. Rearrange: sin(x) - cos(x) = 0
2. Divide by cos(x) (assuming cos(x) ≠ 0): sin(x)/cos(x) = 1
3. This gives us: tan(x) = 1
4. Solving: x = 45° or x = 225°
5. We need to check if cos(x) = 0 anywhere:
   - At x = 90° and x = 270°, cos(x) = 0
   - But sin(90°) = 1 ≠ 0 and sin(270°) = -1 ≠ 0, so these aren't solutions
6. Solutions in [0°, 360°): x = 45°, x = 225°"

### 9. Using Technology to Solve and Verify

**Simple explanation:** "Graphing calculators and software can help us solve and verify trigonometric equations by finding intersection points or zeros of functions."

**Methods:**
1. **Graphical method:**
   - Graph both sides of the equation as separate functions
   - Find the x-coordinates of intersection points
   
2. **Zero-finding method:**
   - Rearrange the equation so one side is zero
   - Graph the resulting function
   - Find the x-coordinates where the graph crosses the x-axis

**Example:**
"To solve cos(x) = x/2 graphically:
1. Graph y = cos(x) and y = x/2 on the same coordinate system
2. Find the x-coordinates of the intersection points
3. These are the solutions to the equation"

### 10. Applications of Trigonometric Equations

**Simple explanation:** "Trigonometric equations appear in many real-world applications involving periodic phenomena."

**Common applications:**
1. **Physics:**
   - Simple harmonic motion (pendulums, springs)
   - Wave phenomena (sound, light, water waves)
   - Alternating current in electrical circuits

2. **Engineering:**
   - Signal processing
   - Control systems
   - Vibration analysis

3. **Natural phenomena:**
   - Tides
   - Seasonal temperature variations
   - Planetary motion

**Example problem:**
"The height h (in meters) of a tidal wave at a certain beach can be modeled by h = 2.5·sin(π/6·t) + 3, where t is the time in hours since midnight. At what times during the first 24 hours is the height exactly 4 meters?

Solution:
1. Set up the equation: 2.5·sin(π/6·t) + 3 = 4
2. Rearrange: 2.5·sin(π/6·t) = 1
3. Divide both sides by 2.5: sin(π/6·t) = 0.4
4. Find the principal solutions: π/6·t = sin⁻¹(0.4) ≈ 23.6° or π/6·t = 180° - 23.6° = 156.4°
5. Convert to radians: π/6·t ≈ 0.412 or π/6·t ≈ 2.73
6. Solve for t: t ≈ 0.412/(π/6) ≈ 0.79 hours or t ≈ 2.73/(π/6) ≈ 5.21 hours
7. Find additional solutions in the first 24 hours using the period (12 hours):
   - t ≈ 0.79 + 12 = 12.79 hours
   - t ≈ 5.21 + 12 = 17.21 hours
8. The height is exactly 4 meters at approximately 0.79, 5.21, 12.79, and 17.21 hours after midnight."
