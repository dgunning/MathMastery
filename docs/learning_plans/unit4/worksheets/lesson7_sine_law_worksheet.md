## Answer Key

### Part A: Understanding the Sine Law

1. The Sine Law states that in any triangle ABC with sides a, b, and c opposite to angles A, B, and C respectively:
   a/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C) = 2R, where R is the radius of the circumscribed circle.
   
   It is appropriate to use the Sine Law when:
   - You know two angles and one side (AAS or ASA cases)
   - You know two sides and the angle opposite to one of them (SSA case, which may lead to the ambiguous case)

2. a) Sine Law is not appropriate; use Cosine Law instead (SSS case).
   b) Sine Law is not appropriate; use Cosine Law instead (SAS case).
   c) Sine Law is not appropriate; use Cosine Law instead (SAS case).
   d) Sine Law is appropriate (AAS case).

3. In triangle ABC with a = 12 cm, b = 18 cm, and A = 35°:
   Using the Sine Law: a/sin(A) = b/sin(B)
   12/sin(35°) = 18/sin(B)
   sin(B) = (18 × sin(35°))/12 = 18 × 0.5736/12 = 0.8604
   B = sin⁻¹(0.8604) ≈ 59.4°

### Part B: Solving Triangles Using the Sine Law (ASA and AAS Cases)

4. a) A = 42°, B = 68°, a = 15 cm
      C = 180° - 42° - 68° = 70°

5. a) P = 65°, Q = 48°, p = 10 cm
      R = 180° - 65° - 48° = 67°
      q = p × sin(Q)/sin(P) = 10 × sin(48°)/sin(65°) = 10 × 0.7431/0.9063 = 8.2 cm
      r = p × sin(R)/sin(P) = 10 × sin(67°)/sin(65°) = 10 × 0.9205/0.9063 = 10.2 cm

   b) P = 105°, R = 35°, q = 15 cm
      Q = 180° - 105° - 35° = 40°
      p = q × sin(P)/sin(Q) = 15 × sin(105°)/sin(40°) = 15 × 0.9659/0.6428 = 22.6 cm
      r = q × sin(R)/sin(Q) = 15 × sin(35°)/sin(40°) = 15 × 0.5736/0.6428 = 13.4 cm

   c) Q = 42°, R = 78°, p = 25 cm
      P = 180° - 42° - 78° = 60°
      q = p × sin(Q)/sin(P) = 25 × sin(42°)/sin(60°) = 25 × 0.6691/0.8660 = 19.3 cm
      r = p × sin(R)/sin(P) = 25 × sin(78°)/sin(60°) = 25 × 0.9781/0.8660 = 28.2 cm

6. For a triangular plot with angles 62° and 53°:
   The third angle = 180° - 62° - 53° = 65°
   If the side opposite to the 62° angle is 85 meters:
   Side opposite to 53° = 85 × sin(53°)/sin(62°) = 85 × 0.8038/0.8829 = 77.4 meters
   Side opposite to 65° = 85 × sin(65°)/sin(62°) = 85 × 0.9063/0.8829 = 87.3 meters

    AB = 12 km, BC = 8 km, angle BAC = 110° - 65° = 45°
    
    Using the Law of Cosines:
    AC² = AB² + BC² - 2(AB)(BC)cos(ABC)
    ABC = 180° - 45° = 135°
    AC² = 12² + 8² - 2(12)(8)cos(135°)
    AC² = 144 + 64 - 2(12)(8)(-0.7071)
    AC² = 208 + 135.8
    AC² = 343.8
    AC = √343.8 ≈ 18.5 km

### Part D: Applications of the Sine Law

11. Let h be the height of the building, d₁ = 50 m, α₁ = 32°, and α₂ = 58°.
    In triangle ABC:
    tan(α₁) = h/d₂
    tan(α₂) = h/d₁
    h = d₂ × tan(α₁) = d₁ × tan(α₂)
    d₂ = d₁ × tan(α₂)/tan(α₁) = 50 × tan(58°)/tan(32°) = 50 × 1.6003/0.6249 = 128.0 m
    h = d₂ × tan(α₁) = 128.0 × 0.6249 = 80.0 m

12. Let h be the height of the tower, d = 500 m, α₁ = 28°, and α₂ = 42°.
    Using similar triangles:
    h/tan(α₁) - h/tan(α₂) = 500
    h(1/tan(α₁) - 1/tan(α₂)) = 500
    h = 500/(1/tan(α₁) - 1/tan(α₂))
    h = 500/(1/0.5317 - 1/0.9004) = 500/(1.8808 - 1.1106) = 500/0.7702 = 649.2 m

13. For the ship problem:
    Let A be the port, B the first position, and C the final position.
    AB = 85 km, BC = 65 km, angle ABC = 215° - 125° = 90°
    
    Using the Pythagorean theorem:
    AC² = AB² + BC²
    AC² = 85² + 65²
    AC² = 7225 + 4225 = 11450
    AC = √11450 ≈ 107.0 km

14. Let h₁ and h₂ be the heights of the towers, d = 200 m, α₁ = 35°, and α₂ = 55°.
    h₁ = d × tan(α₁) = 200 × tan(35°) = 200 × 0.7002 = 140.0 m
    h₂ = d × tan(α₂) = 200 × tan(55°) = 200 × 1.4281 = 285.6 m

15. For the hot air balloon problem:
    Let h be the height of the balloon, d = 800 m, α₁ = 52°, and α₂ = 38°.
    
    Using the Sine Law:
    Let x be the horizontal distance from point A to the balloon.
    tan(α₁) = h/x
    tan(α₂) = h/(d-x)
    
    h = x × tan(α₁) = (d-x) × tan(α₂)
    x × tan(α₁) = (d-x) × tan(α₂)
    x × tan(α₁) = d × tan(α₂) - x × tan(α₂)
    x × (tan(α₁) + tan(α₂)) = d × tan(α₂)
    x = d × tan(α₂)/(tan(α₁) + tan(α₂))
    x = 800 × tan(38°)/(tan(52°) + tan(38°))
    x = 800 × 0.7813/(1.2799 + 0.7813) = 800 × 0.7813/2.0612 = 303.1 m
    
    h = x × tan(α₁) = 303.1 × tan(52°) = 303.1 × 1.2799 = 388.0 m

### Part E: Connection to the Circumscribed Circle

16. In any triangle, the Sine Law can be written as:
    a/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C) = 2R
    
    Therefore, a = 2R × sin(A)

17. For a triangle with sides 12 cm, 15 cm, and 18 cm:
    Using the Law of Cosines to find the angles:
    cos(A) = (b² + c² - a²)/(2bc) = (15² + 18² - 12²)/(2 × 15 × 18) = (225 + 324 - 144)/(540) = 405/540 = 0.75
    A = cos⁻¹(0.75) = 41.4°
    
    Using the Sine Law:
    R = a/(2sin(A)) = 12/(2 × sin(41.4°)) = 12/(2 × 0.6602) = 9.1 cm

18. In triangle PQR with P = 45°, Q = 60°, and p = 10 cm:
    R = 180° - 45° - 60° = 75°
    
    Using the Sine Law:
    p/sin(P) = 2R
    R = p/(2sin(P)) = 10/(2 × sin(45°)) = 10/(2 × 0.7071) = 7.1 cm

19. For a triangle with angles 35°, 65°, and 80°:
    The shortest side is opposite to the smallest angle (35°).
    
    Using the Sine Law:
    a/sin(A) = 2R
    8/sin(35°) = 2R
    R = 8/(2 × sin(35°)) = 8/(2 × 0.5736) = 7.0 cm

20. For a triangle with angles 42°, 58°, and 80° (since angles in a triangle sum to 180°):
    Using the Sine Law with R = 12 cm:
    a = 2R × sin(A) = 2 × 12 × sin(42°) = 24 × 0.6691 = 16.1 cm
    b = 2R × sin(B) = 2 × 12 × sin(58°) = 24 × 0.8480 = 20.4 cm
    c = 2R × sin(C) = 2 × 12 × sin(80°) = 24 × 0.9848 = 23.6 cm
