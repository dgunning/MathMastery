### Part B: Relationships Between Trigonometric Ratios

3. If sin(θ) = 3/5 and θ is in the first quadrant:
   a) Using sin²(θ) + cos²(θ) = 1:
      cos²(θ) = 1 - sin²(θ) = 1 - (3/5)² = 1 - 9/25 = 16/25
      cos(θ) = 4/5 (positive in first quadrant)
   b) tan(θ) = sin(θ)/cos(θ) = (3/5)/(4/5) = 3/4
   c) csc(θ) = 1/sin(θ) = 1/(3/5) = 5/3
   d) sec(θ) = 1/cos(θ) = 1/(4/5) = 5/4
   e) cot(θ) = 1/tan(θ) = 1/(3/4) = 4/3

4. If cos(θ) = 5/13 and θ is in the first quadrant:
   a) Using sin²(θ) + cos²(θ) = 1:
      sin²(θ) = 1 - cos²(θ) = 1 - (5/13)² = 1 - 25/169 = 144/169
      sin(θ) = 12/13 (positive in first quadrant)
   b) tan(θ) = sin(θ)/cos(θ) = (12/13)/(5/13) = 12/5
   c) csc(θ) = 1/sin(θ) = 1/(12/13) = 13/12
   d) sec(θ) = 1/cos(θ) = 1/(5/13) = 13/5
   e) cot(θ) = 1/tan(θ) = 1/(12/5) = 5/12

5. If tan(θ) = 4/3 and θ is in the first quadrant:
   a) Using 1 + tan²(θ) = sec²(θ):
      sec²(θ) = 1 + (4/3)² = 1 + 16/9 = 25/9
      sec(θ) = 5/3 (positive in first quadrant)
      cos(θ) = 1/sec(θ) = 1/(5/3) = 3/5
   b) sin(θ) = tan(θ) × cos(θ) = (4/3) × (3/5) = 4/5
   c) csc(θ) = 1/sin(θ) = 1/(4/5) = 5/4
   d) sec(θ) = 5/3 (already calculated)
   e) cot(θ) = 1/tan(θ) = 1/(4/3) = 3/4

### Part C: Verifying Trigonometric Identities

6. a) sin²(θ) + cos²(θ) = 1
      This is a fundamental identity.

   b) 1 + tan²(θ) = sec²(θ)
      1 + tan²(θ) = 1 + (sin(θ)/cos(θ))² = 1 + sin²(θ)/cos²(θ) = (cos²(θ) + sin²(θ))/cos²(θ) = 1/cos²(θ) = sec²(θ)

   c) 1 + cot²(θ) = csc²(θ)
      1 + cot²(θ) = 1 + (cos(θ)/sin(θ))² = 1 + cos²(θ)/sin²(θ) = (sin²(θ) + cos²(θ))/sin²(θ) = 1/sin²(θ) = csc²(θ)

   d) sin(θ)·csc(θ) = sin(θ)·(1/sin(θ)) = 1

   e) cos(θ)·sec(θ) = cos(θ)·(1/cos(θ)) = 1

   f) tan(θ)·cot(θ) = (sin(θ)/cos(θ))·(cos(θ)/sin(θ)) = 1

7. a) tan(θ) + cot(θ) = sin(θ)/cos(θ) + cos(θ)/sin(θ) = (sin²(θ) + cos²(θ))/(sin(θ)·cos(θ)) = 1/(sin(θ)·cos(θ))

   b) sec(θ) · csc(θ) = 1/cos(θ) · 1/sin(θ) = 1/(sin(θ)·cos(θ))

   c) (sin(θ) + cos(θ))² = sin²(θ) + 2sin(θ)cos(θ) + cos²(θ) = 1 + 2sin(θ)cos(θ)

### Part D: Applications

8. For a ladder 10 meters long at an angle of 65° with the ground:
   - Height up the wall = 10 × sin(65°) = 10 × 0.9063 ≈ 9.06 meters
   - Distance from wall to base of ladder = 10 × cos(65°) = 10 × 0.4226 ≈ 4.23 meters

9. For a tree with angle of elevation 32° from a point 30 meters away:
   - Height of tree = 30 × tan(32°) = 30 × 0.6249 ≈ 18.75 meters

10. For a ramp with 15° angle of elevation and horizontal distance 12 meters:
    - Length of ramp = 12/cos(15°) = 12/0.9659 ≈ 12.42 meters
    - Vertical height = 12 × tan(15°) = 12 × 0.2680 ≈ 3.22 meters
