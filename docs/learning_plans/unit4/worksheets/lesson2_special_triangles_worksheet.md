2. In a 45°-45°-90° triangle with hypotenuse of length 10 cm:
   a) Each leg = 10/√2 = 10√2/2 = 5√2 ≈ 7.07 cm
   b) Area = (1/2) × 5√2 × 5√2 = 25 cm²

   b) Area = (6√2)² = 72 cm²
   c) Perimeter = 4 × 6√2 = 24√2 ≈ 33.94 cm

4. Using a 45°-45°-90° triangle with legs of length 1:
   - Hypotenuse = √2
   - sin(45°) = opposite/hypotenuse = 1/√2 = √2/2
   - cos(45°) = adjacent/hypotenuse = 1/√2 = √2/2
   - tan(45°) = opposite/adjacent = 1/1 = 1

9. For a 10-meter ladder at 45° angle:
   - Height up wall = 10 × sin(45°) = 10 × (√2/2) = 5√2 ≈ 7.07 meters

13. For a rhombus with diagonals 10 cm and 24 cm:
    a) Side length = √((10/2)² + (24/2)²) = √(25 + 144) = √169 = 13 cm
    b) Angles: Using inverse tangent of the ratio of half-diagonals:
       - Smaller angle = 2 × tan⁻¹(5/12) ≈ 2 × 22.6° = 45.2°
       - Larger angle = 180° - 45.2° = 134.8°

14. For a regular octagon inscribed in a circle of radius 10 cm:
    a) Side length = 2 × 10 × sin(π/8) = 20 × sin(22.5°) = 20 × 0.3827 ≈ 7.65 cm
