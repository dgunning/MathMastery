## Key Concepts to Cover

### 1. Review of Basic Factoring

**Simple explanation:** "Before we dive into advanced factoring, let's quickly review what you already know. Factoring is like unpacking a mathematical expression into its simplest parts - the factors that multiply together to create the original expression."

**Quick review examples:**
- Common factor: 12x + 8 = 4(3x + 2)
- Difference of squares: x² - 16 = (x + 4)(x - 4)
- Simple trinomials: x² + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)

**Connection to new material:** "Now we're going to build on these skills to handle more complex expressions that don't factor as easily."

### 2. Factoring Trinomials with Leading Coefficients

**Simple explanation:** "When the coefficient of x² isn't 1, we need additional strategies. For example, in 2x² + 7x + 3, the 2 in front of x² makes things a bit more challenging."

**Method 1: Grouping method**

1. Multiply a × c (the first and last coefficients)
2. Find two numbers that multiply to give a × c and add to give b (the middle coefficient)
3. Split the middle term using these numbers
4. Factor by grouping

**Example walkthrough:**
```
Factor: 2x² + 7x + 3

Step 1: Multiply a × c = 2 × 3 = 6
Step 2: Find two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to 7
        Those numbers are 1 and 6
Step 3: Split the middle term: 2x² + x + 6x + 3
Step 4: Factor by grouping:
        (2x² + x) + (6x + 3)
        x(2x + 1) + 3(2x + 1)
        (2x + 1)(x + 3)
```

**Method 2: Trial and error with the AC method**

**Example walkthrough:**
```
Factor: 3x² - 10x + 8

Step 1: Multiply a × c = 3 × 8 = 24
Step 2: Find factors of 24 that add up to -10
        Those factors are -4 and -6
Step 3: Rewrite the middle term: 3x² - 4x - 6x + 8
Step 4: Group and factor:
        (3x² - 4x) + (-6x + 8)
        x(3x - 4) - 2(3x - 4)
        (3x - 4)(x - 2)
```

**Interactive activity:** "Let's try a few examples together, walking through each step:"
1. 4x² + 15x + 9
2. 6x² - 19x + 10
3. 3x² + x - 2

### 3. Factoring by Substitution

**Simple explanation:** "Sometimes expressions look complicated, but we can simplify them by treating certain parts as a single variable."

**Example 1: Quadratic-like expressions**
```
Factor: x⁴ - 5x² + 4

Step 1: Let u = x²
Step 2: Rewrite as u² - 5u + 4
Step 3: Factor this simpler expression: (u - 1)(u - 4)
Step 4: Substitute back: (x² - 1)(x² - 4)
Step 5: Further factor if possible: (x² - 1)(x² - 4) = (x + 1)(x - 1)(x + 2)(x - 2)
```

**Example 2: With a different substitution**
```
Factor: 2(x + 3)² - 7(x + 3) + 3

Step 1: Let u = (x + 3)
Step 2: Rewrite as 2u² - 7u + 3
Step 3: Factor this simpler expression: (2u - 1)(u - 3)
Step 4: Substitute back: (2(x + 3) - 1)((x + 3) - 3)
Step 5: Simplify: (2x + 6 - 1)(x + 3 - 3) = (2x + 5)(x)
```

**Key point:** "Substitution turns complex-looking problems into ones we already know how to solve. The trick is identifying what to substitute."

### 4. Factoring Sum and Difference of Cubes

**Formulas to know:**
- Sum of cubes: a³ + b³ = (a + b)(a² - ab + b²)
- Difference of cubes: a³ - b³ = (a - b)(a² + ab + b²)

**Memory trick:** "For the second factor, the signs follow this pattern:
- For sum of cubes (a³ + b³): a² - ab + b²  (always minus in the middle)
- For difference of cubes (a³ - b³): a² + ab + b²  (always plus in the middle)"

**Example walkthrough:**
```
Factor: x³ + 27

Step 1: Identify as sum of cubes: x³ + 3³
Step 2: Apply the formula: (x + 3)(x² - 3x + 9)
```

```
Factor: 8x³ - 125

Step 1: Identify as difference of cubes: (2x)³ - 5³
Step 2: Apply the formula: (2x - 5)((2x)² + 2x·5 + 5²)
Step 3: Simplify: (2x - 5)(4x² + 10x + 25)
```

**Visual demonstration:** "Draw a cube with side length (a + b). The volume is (a + b)³, which equals a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³. But we can also see it as (a + b)(a² + 2ab + b²), which helps us understand where the factoring formula comes from."

### 5. Complex Polynomial Factoring Strategy

**General strategy for factoring complex polynomials:**

1. Check for common factors first
2. Identify the type of expression:
   - Difference of squares: a² - b²
   - Sum/difference of cubes: a³ ± b³
   - Trinomial: ax² + bx + c
   - Other: Consider substitution
3. After factoring, check if any of the factors can be factored further
4. Verify by multiplying the factors

**Example of a multi-step factoring:**
```
Factor completely: 2x⁵ - 32x³

Step 1: Factor out common term: 2x³(x² - 16)
Step 2: Factor the difference of squares: 2x³(x + 4)(x - 4)
```

```
Factor completely: x⁴ - 16

Step 1: Factor as difference of squares: (x² + 4)(x² - 4)
Step 2: Factor the second term further: (x² + 4)(x + 2)(x - 2)
```

### 6. Factoring Strategy Summary

**Decision tree for factoring:**

1. Check for GCF (Greatest Common Factor)
2. How many terms?
   - 2 terms: Check for difference of squares (a² - b²), sum/difference of cubes (a³ ± b³)
   - 3 terms: Try factoring as a trinomial
   - 4 terms: Try factoring by grouping
3. Look for substitution opportunities
4. Factor each resulting expression recursively
5. Verify your answer by multiplying the factors

**Practice flow chart:** "Draw this decision tree and work through it for each practice problem."

## Check for Understanding

After covering the material, ask these questions:

1. "What's the first thing you should check for when factoring any expression?"
2. "How do you factor a trinomial where the coefficient of x² is not 1?"
3. "What's the difference between factoring a sum of cubes and a difference of cubes?"
4. "How do you know when to use substitution?"
5. "Can you factor x⁴ - 81 completely?"

2. (4x - 1)(3x - 2)
3. (x - 3)(x² + 3x + 9)
4. (x + 4)(x² - 4x + 16)
5. 3(x⁴ - 16) = 3(x² + 4)(x² - 4) = 3(x² + 4)(x + 2)(x - 2)
6. Let u = (x - 3), then 2u² + 5u - 3 = (2u - 1)(u + 3) = (2(x - 3) - 1)((x - 3) + 3) = (2x - 7)(x)
7. 4x²(x² - 1) = 4x²(x + 1)(x - 1)
8. 2x(x² + 27) = 2x(x + 3)(x² - 3x + 9)

## Tips for Teaching Success
