# Introduction to Functions

## What You're Learning

Functions are mathematical relationships where each input has exactly one output

## Why This Matters

**Real-World Applications:**
- **App Development:** When you open Instagram or TikTok, functions determine what content appears in your feed. Software engineers at these companies (earning $130,000+) write functions that transform your preferences into personalized recommendations.

- **Video Game Design:** Games like Fortnite and Minecraft use functions to control everything from character movement to world generation. Game developers at companies like Epic Games and Roblox (earning $120,000+) create functions that translate player inputs into in-game actions.

- **Data Science & AI:** When Netflix recommends shows or Spotify creates playlists, they're using functions to analyze your viewing or listening patterns. Data scientists (earning $135,000+) build complex mathematical functions that predict your preferences.

- **Financial Technology:** Banking apps use functions to calculate interest, investment returns, and loan payments. Financial analysts (earning $95,000+) at companies like Robinhood and Chase rely on functions to model economic trends and optimize investment strategies.

**Career Connection:** Understanding functions is essential for high-growth careers in technology, engineering, data analysis, scientific research, and finance. Beyond the impressive salaries, these fields offer the opportunity to build tools that millions of people use daily. The mathematical relationships you're learning today form the foundation of algorithms that power our digital world.

## Key Concepts

### 1. What is a Function?

**Simple explanation:** A function is a special relationship where each input has exactly one output. Think of it as a machine that takes something in and gives exactly one thing out.

**Real-world example:** "When you press a specific button on a video game controller, it always produces the same action in the game. Press A, you jump. Press B, you run. Each button (input) results in exactly one action (output)."

**Visual aid:** Draw a simple "function machine" on paper:
```
    INPUT               FUNCTION MACHINE               OUTPUT
   (domain)                                            (range)
     x ----->           [f(x) = 2x + 3]  ------>  y = f(x)
```

**Key point to emphasize:** "The important part is that a function can never give two different answers for the same input. It's like a reliable recipe - same ingredients, same cooking time, same result every time."

### 2. Relations vs. Functions

**Simple explanation:** "All functions are relations (relationships between inputs and outputs), but not all relations are functions. A function has the special rule that each input gives exactly one output."

**Activity: "Is It a Function?" Game**

Materials needed:
- Paper and pencil OR 
- Computer with spreadsheet program

Instructions:
1. Create a table with the following examples (or make up your own):

| Relation | Description | Function? |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| A | Your age → your height | Yes |
| B | Your shoe size → your name | No |
| C | Time of day → temperature outside | Yes |
| D | A person → their parents | No |
| E | Price of a game → sales tax amount | Yes |
| F | Your Xbox gamertag → your game level | Yes |
| G | A city → its elevation | Yes |
| H | A movie → its actors | No |

2. For each relation, ask:
   - "Can one input have multiple outputs?"
   - "If I give you the same input twice, will I always get the same output?"

3. Identify which are functions by applying the "one input → one output" rule.

### 3. The Vertical Line Test

**Simple explanation:** "This is a quick visual way to tell if a graph shows a function. If you can draw any vertical line that crosses the graph more than once, then it's not a function."

**Visual aid:** Draw these examples:

1. A parabola (y = x²): Function ✓
2. A circle: Not a function ✗
3. A horizontal line (y = 3): Function ✓
4. A vertical line (x = 2): Not a function ✗

**Interactive activity:** 
1. Use the free website Desmos.com
2. Type these equations:
   - y = x²
   - x² + y² = 9 (a circle)
   - y = |x|
   - x = |y|
3. Drag a vertical line across each graph to see if it ever crosses more than once

**Key point:** "The vertical line test works because a vertical line represents the same x-value (input). If the line crosses the graph twice, that means one input gives two outputs, which breaks the function rule."

### 4. Domain and Range

**Simple explanation:**
- "The domain is all the possible input values (x-values) a function can accept"
- "The range is all the possible output values (y-values) a function can produce"

**Real-world example:**
"Think of ordering at a fast-food restaurant:
- The domain is everything on the menu (all possible orders)
- The range is all the food/drinks you might receive
- Each order (input) gives you one specific meal combination (output)"

**Activity: "Real Life Domain and Range"**

For each scenario, identify the domain and range:

1. **Video Game Character Level**
   - Function: Time played → Character level
   - Domain: 0 hours to unlimited hours
   - Range: Level 1 to maximum level (e.g., 60)
   
2. **YouTube Video Views**
   - Function: Days since posting → Number of views
   - Domain: 0 days to present
   - Range: 0 views to unlimited views
   
3. **Basketball Shots**
   - Function: Distance from basket → Probability of making the shot
   - Domain: 0 feet to court length
   - Range: 0% to 100%

**Discussion questions:**
- "Why can't your character be level -5?" (Domain restrictions)
- "Why can't you have -10 YouTube views?" (Range restrictions)
- "Why can't you have a 110% chance of making a basketball shot?" (Range restrictions)

### 5. Function Notation

**Simple explanation:** "Function notation is just a shorthand way to write functions. Instead of saying 'y equals 2 times x plus 3,' we can write f(x) = 2x + 3."

**Important points:**
- "f(x) means 'the output when the input is x'"
- "It's NOT f times x. It's 'f of x'"
- "You can use other letters too: g(x), h(x), etc."

**Practice: "What's the Output?"**

For the function f(x) = 2x + 3:
1. Find f(0) [Answer: 3]
2. Find f(2) [Answer: 7]
3. Find f(-1) [Answer: 1]
4. If f(a) = 13, what is a? [Answer: 5]

**Real-world application:**
"If C(h) represents the cost of using your phone for h hours, and C(h) = 10 + 5h dollars:
- What does C(0) mean? (Cost with 0 hours: $10, the monthly fee)
- What does C(3) mean? (Cost for 3 hours: $25)
- If C(h) = 40, how many hours did you use? (6 hours)"

### 6. Multiple Representations of Functions

Functions can be represented in 4 ways:

1. **Verbally (words):** "Add 3 to twice the input"
2. **Algebraically (equation):** f(x) = 2x + 3
3. **Numerically (table):**

   | x | f(x) |
   |---|------|
   | 0 | 3    |
   | 1 | 5    |
   | 2 | 7    |

4. **Graphically (graph):** [A straight line with slope 2 and y-intercept 3]

**Activity: "Four Ways to Show It"**
Pick a simple function like f(x) = |x| (absolute value) and show all four representations.

## Check for Understanding

After covering the material, ask these questions:

1. "What makes a relation a function?"
2. "What is the vertical line test checking for?"
3. "In your own words, what are domain and range?"
4. "If f(x) = 3x - 4, what is f(2)? What about f(-1)?"
5. "Give me an example of a function from everyday life."

## Tips for Teaching Success

1. **Connect to interests:** Use examples from gaming, sports, social media, or whatever you enjoy.
2. **Be patient:** Functions are abstract. It might take several attempts for the concept to click.
3. **Use visuals:** Draw pictures, use online tools, or create physical models.
4. **Take breaks:** If frustration builds, switch to another activity and come back later.
5. **Celebrate understanding:** When concepts click, acknowledge the achievement.

## Next Steps

Once you understands these basics, you can move on to:
1. Function transformations (how changing the equation affects the graph)
2. Special functions (quadratic, exponential, etc.)
3. Function operations (adding, subtracting, multiplying functions)

**Remember:** The goal is understanding, not memorization. If you can explain the concepts in your own words and apply them to new situations, you're on the right track!
