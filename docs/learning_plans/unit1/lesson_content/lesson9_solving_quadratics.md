## Key Concepts to Cover

### 1. Understanding Quadratic Equations

**Simple explanation:** "A quadratic equation has the form ax² + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are constants and a ≠ 0. The solutions to this equation are the values of x that make the equation true - also called the roots or zeros."

**Key insight:** "The solutions to a quadratic equation correspond to the x-coordinates of the points where the parabola y = ax² + bx + c crosses the x-axis."

**Visual representation:**
```
    y = ax² + bx + c
         |                      
         |                      
         |       /|\           
         |      / | \          
         |     /  |  \         
    -----+----+---+---+------
         |   /    |    \      
         |  /     |     \     
         | /      |      \    
         |/       |       \   
    x₁---+--------+--------+---x₂
        root1             root2
```

**Types of solutions:**
- Two distinct real solutions: The parabola crosses the x-axis at two points
- One repeated real solution: The parabola touches the x-axis at one point (the vertex)
- No real solutions: The parabola doesn't intersect the x-axis

### 2. Solving by Factoring

**Simple explanation:** "If we can factor the quadratic expression into two binomials, we can easily find the solutions using the Zero Product Property: if a × b = 0, then either a = 0 or b = 0."

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Make sure the equation is in standard form: ax² + bx + c = 0
2. Factor the left side of the equation
3. Set each factor equal to zero
4. Solve the resulting equations

**Example 1: When a = 1**
```
Solve x² + 5x + 6 = 0

Step 1: Factor the left side
        x² + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)
        
Step 2: Set each factor equal to zero
        x + 2 = 0  or  x + 3 = 0
        
Step 3: Solve each equation
        x = -2  or  x = -3
        
Step 4: Check in the original equation
        (-2)² + 5(-2) + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0 ✓
        (-3)² + 5(-3) + 6 = 9 - 15 + 6 = 0 ✓
```

**Example 2: When a ≠ 1**
```
Solve 2x² - 5x - 3 = 0

Step 1: Factor the left side
        2x² - 5x - 3 = (2x + 1)(x - 3)
        
Step 2: Set each factor equal to zero
        2x + 1 = 0  or  x - 3 = 0
        
Step 3: Solve each equation
        x = -1/2  or  x = 3
        
Step 4: Check in the original equation
        2(-1/2)² - 5(-1/2) - 3 = 2(1/4) + 5/2 - 3 = 1/2 + 5/2 - 3 = 3 - 3 = 0 ✓
        2(3)² - 5(3) - 3 = 2(9) - 15 - 3 = 18 - 15 - 3 = 0 ✓
```

**Factoring strategies review:**
- For ax² + bx + c (a = 1): Find two numbers that multiply to give c and add to give b
- For ax² + bx + c (a ≠ 1): Find two numbers that multiply to give ac and add to give b, then use those to rewrite the middle term and group

**Key insight:** "Not all quadratic expressions can be factored using integers or rational numbers. When factoring doesn't work, we need other methods."

### 3. The Quadratic Formula

**Simple explanation:** "The quadratic formula gives us the solutions to any quadratic equation. For the equation ax² + bx + c = 0, the solutions are:

x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)

This formula comes from completing the square on the general form of a quadratic equation."

**When to use it:** "The quadratic formula works for every quadratic equation, but it's especially useful when:
- The quadratic expression doesn't factor nicely
- You want to find decimal approximations of solutions
- You need to determine the exact form of irrational solutions"

**Example 1: Two distinct real solutions**
```
Solve x² - 5x + 3 = 0

Step 1: Identify a = 1, b = -5, c = 3
        
Step 2: Apply the quadratic formula
        x = [5 ± √((-5)² - 4(1)(3))] / 2(1)
        x = [5 ± √(25 - 12)] / 2
        x = [5 ± √13] / 2
        
Step 3: Calculate both solutions
        x = (5 + √13) / 2 ≈ 4.30
        x = (5 - √13) / 2 ≈ 0.70
```

**Example 2: One repeated solution**
```
Solve 4x² - 12x + 9 = 0

Step 1: Identify a = 4, b = -12, c = 9
        
Step 2: Apply the quadratic formula
        x = [12 ± √((-12)² - 4(4)(9))] / 2(4)
        x = [12 ± √(144 - 144)] / 8
        x = [12 ± 0] / 8
        x = 12/8 = 3/2
        
Step 3: There is only one solution: x = 3/2
```

**Example 3: No real solutions**
```
Solve 2x² + x + 1 = 0

Step 1: Identify a = 2, b = 1, c = 1
        
Step 2: Apply the quadratic formula
        x = [-1 ± √((1)² - 4(2)(1))] / 2(2)
        x = [-1 ± √(1 - 8)] / 4
        x = [-1 ± √(-7)] / 4
        
Step 3: Since the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions
        (Note: There are two complex solutions, but they're beyond the scope of this lesson)
```

**Tip for calculations:** "Always simplify the discriminant (b² - 4ac) first to determine the nature of the solutions. This can save you work and help avoid errors."

### 4. Choosing the Best Method

**Simple explanation:** "There are several methods for solving quadratic equations, and the best one depends on the specific equation."

**Decision tree:**
1. Is the equation already in factored form like (x + a)(x + b) = 0? 
   - Yes → Use the Zero Product Property
   - No → Continue

2. Does one side of the equation equal zero? 
   - No → Rearrange to standard form
   - Yes → Continue

3. Can the quadratic expression be factored easily?
   - Yes → Use factoring
   - No → Continue

4. Is the coefficient of x² equal to 1, and are the other coefficients "nice" numbers?
   - Yes → Consider completing the square
   - No → Use the quadratic formula

**Examples of choosing methods:**
```
For x² - 4 = 0:
- This can be rewritten as x² = 4
- Then x = ±2
- Fastest method: Square root property
```

```
For x² - 6x + 9 = 0:
- This factors as (x - 3)² = 0
- Therefore x = 3
- Fastest method: Factoring
```

```
For 2x² - 7x + 3 = 0:
- This doesn't factor nicely with integers
- Fastest method: Quadratic formula
```

**Key insight:** "The quadratic formula always works, but other methods might be faster in specific cases."

### 5. Word Problems Involving Quadratic Equations

**Simple explanation:** "Many real-world problems lead to quadratic equations. The challenge is translating the problem into an equation."

**General approach:**
1. Identify the unknown quantity and assign a variable
2. Express the conditions of the problem in terms of the variable
3. Form a quadratic equation
4. Solve the equation
5. Answer the original question, making sure the answer makes sense in context

**Example 1: Area problem**
```
The length of a rectangle is 3 meters more than its width. If the area is 70 square meters, find the dimensions.

Step 1: Let w = width of the rectangle
        Then w + 3 = length

Step 2: Area = length × width
        70 = (w + 3) × w
        70 = w² + 3w
        
Step 3: Rearrange to standard form
        w² + 3w - 70 = 0
        
Step 4: Solve using the quadratic formula
        w = [-3 ± √(9 + 280)] / 2
        w = [-3 ± √289] / 2
        w = [-3 ± 17] / 2
        w = 7 or w = -10
        
Step 5: Since width can't be negative, w = 7 meters
        Therefore, length = 7 + 3 = 10 meters
```

**Example 2: Projectile motion**
```
A ball is thrown upward from a height of 6 feet with an initial velocity of 32 feet per second. The height h(t) after t seconds is given by h(t) = -16t² + 32t + 6. When does the ball hit the ground?

Step 1: The ball hits the ground when h(t) = 0
        -16t² + 32t + 6 = 0
        
Step 2: Solve using the quadratic formula
        t = [-32 ± √(1024 + 384)] / -32
        t = [-32 ± √1408] / -32
        t = [-32 ± 37.5] / -32
        t ≈ -0.17 or t ≈ 2.17
        
Step 3: Since time can't be negative in this context, the ball hits the ground after approximately 2.17 seconds
```

**Example 3: Number problem**
```
Find two consecutive integers whose product is 156.

Step 1: Let x = first integer
        Then x + 1 = second integer
        
Step 2: Their product is 156
        x(x + 1) = 156
        x² + x = 156
        
Step 3: Rearrange to standard form
        x² + x - 156 = 0
        
Step 4: Factor
        (x + 13)(x - 12) = 0
        
Step 5: Solve
        x = -13 or x = 12
        
Step 6: For x = -13, the consecutive integers are -13 and -12
        For x = 12, the consecutive integers are 12 and 13
        Both pairs work: (-13)(-12) = 156 and (12)(13) = 156
```

### 6. The Square Root Property

**Simple explanation:** "For equations in the form x² = k, we can solve directly using the square root property: if x² = k, then x = ±√k."

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Isolate the squared term
2. Take the square root of both sides
3. Remember to include both the positive and negative square roots

**Examples:**
```
Solve x² - 25 = 0

Step 1: Rearrange to isolate x²
        x² = 25
        
Step 2: Apply the square root property
        x = ±√25 = ±5
        
Step 3: The solutions are x = 5 and x = -5
```

```
Solve 3x² - 75 = 0

Step 1: Rearrange to isolate x²
        3x² = 75
        x² = 25
        
Step 2: Apply the square root property
        x = ±√25 = ±5
        
Step 3: The solutions are x = 5 and x = -5
```

### 7. Solving by Completing the Square

**Simple explanation:** "Completing the square allows us to rewrite a quadratic equation in a form where we can apply the square root property."

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Make sure the coefficient of x² is 1 (divide by the coefficient if necessary)
2. Move the constant term to the right side
3. Complete the square on the left side (add and subtract the appropriate term)
4. Rewrite the left side as a perfect square
5. Solve using the square root property

**Example:**
```
Solve x² - 6x + 5 = 0

Step 1: Move the constant term to the right side
        x² - 6x = -5
        
Step 2: Complete the square
        Half of -6 is -3, and (-3)² = 9
        x² - 6x + 9 = -5 + 9
        
Step 3: Rewrite as a perfect square
        (x - 3)² = 4
        
Step 4: Apply the square root property
        x - 3 = ±2
        x = 3 ± 2
        
Step 5: The solutions are x = 5 and x = 1
```

**Connection to the quadratic formula:** "The quadratic formula is derived by applying the completing the square method to the general form ax² + bx + c = 0."

### 8. Applications in Different Domains

**Simple explanation:** "Quadratic equations appear in many different fields and contexts."

**Physics applications:**
- Projectile motion (height, distance, time)
- Free fall problems
- Energy calculations

**Economics applications:**
- Revenue and profit optimization
- Supply and demand models
- Cost minimization

**Geometry applications:**
- Area and perimeter problems
- Pythagorean theorem applications
- Distance calculations

**Real-world examples:**
```
A company finds that when they price their product at p dollars, they sell (300 - 5p) units. At what price will their revenue be maximized?

Step 1: Revenue = price × quantity
        R = p(300 - 5p) = 300p - 5p²
        
Step 2: To maximize revenue, find where the derivative is zero
        R' = 300 - 10p = 0
        p = 30
        
Step 3: The maximum revenue occurs at a price of $30
```

```
A farmer wants to enclose a rectangular field with 200 meters of fencing. What dimensions will maximize the area?

Step 1: Let x = width, y = length
        Perimeter = 2x + 2y = 200
        y = 100 - x
        
Step 2: Area = x × y = x(100 - x) = 100x - x²
        
Step 3: To maximize area, find where the derivative is zero
        A' = 100 - 2x = 0
        x = 50
        
Step 4: The maximum area is achieved with dimensions 50m × 50m
```

5. The product of two consecutive even integers is 168. What are the integers?

**Solutions:**
1. Factoring:
   - x² + 7x + 12 = 0: (x + 3)(x + 4) = 0, so x = -3 or x = -4
   - 2x² - 5x - 3 = 0: (2x + 1)(x - 3) = 0, so x = -1/2 or x = 3
   - x² - 9 = 0: (x + 3)(x - 3) = 0, so x = -3 or x = 3
   - 3x² - 12 = 0: 3(x² - 4) = 0, so 3(x + 2)(x - 2) = 0, thus x = -2 or x = 2

2. Quadratic formula:
   - x² - 3x - 10 = 0: a = 1, b = -3, c = -10
     x = [3 ± √(9 + 40)]/2 = [3 ± √49]/2 = [3 ± 7]/2, so x = 5 or x = -2
   - 2x² + 5x - 3 = 0: a = 2, b = 5, c = -3
     x = [-5 ± √(25 + 24)]/4 = [-5 ± √49]/4 = [-5 ± 7]/4, so x = 1/2 or x = -3
   - 3x² - 2x + 1 = 0: a = 3, b = -2, c = 1
     x = [2 ± √(4 - 12)]/6 = [2 ± √(-8)]/6, no real solutions
   - 4x² - 12x + 9 = 0: a = 4, b = -12, c = 9
     x = [12 ± √(144 - 144)]/8 = [12 ± 0]/8 = 3/2, one solution

3. Rectangle problem:
   - Let w = width, then w + 5 = length
   - Area = w(w + 5) = 84
   - w² + 5w - 84 = 0
   - (w + 12)(w - 7) = 0
   - w = -12 or w = 7
   - Since width must be positive, w = 7 cm and length = 12 cm

4. Ball problem:
   - The ball hits the ground when h(t) = 0
   - -16t² + 64t = 0
   - -16t(t - 4) = 0
   - t = 0 or t = 4
   - t = 0 is the initial position, so the ball hits the ground again at t = 4 seconds

5. Consecutive even integers problem:
   - Let n = first even integer, then n + 2 = second even integer
   - n(n + 2) = 168
   - n² + 2n - 168 = 0
   - (n + 14)(n - 12) = 0
   - n = -14 or n = 12
   - For n = -14, the integers are -14 and -12
   - For n = 12, the integers are 12 and 14
   - Check: (-14)(-12) = 168 and (12)(14) = 168
