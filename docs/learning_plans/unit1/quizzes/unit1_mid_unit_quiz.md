## Answer Key

### Multiple Choice
1. a) x⁴ - 81
   * (x² - 9)(x² + 9) = x⁴ - 81 (difference of squares)

2. b) All real numbers except x = 2 and x = -2
   * The denominator x²-4 can be factored as (x-2)(x+2), which equals zero when x = 2 or x = -2

3. b) 11
   * f(-2) = 2(-2)² - 3(-2) + 1 = 2(4) + 6 + 1 = 8 + 6 + 1 = 15

4. a) (3, 4)
   * In the form y = a(x - h)² + k, the vertex is (h, k)

5. b) y = |x|
   * This is a function because each input x has exactly one output y

### Short Answer
6. 3x(x² - 4) = 3x(x - 2)(x + 2)
   * Factor out the GCF 3x, then use the difference of squares formula

7. Domain: x ≥ 2; Range: y ≥ 0
   * The expression under the square root must be non-negative, so x - 2 ≥ 0, which gives x ≥ 2
   * The square root function always gives non-negative values, so the range is y ≥ 0

8. f(a + 2) = (a + 2)² - 4(a + 2) + 7 = a² + 4a + 4 - 4a - 8 + 7 = a² + 3
   * Substitute a + 2 for x in the function and simplify

9. Vertex: (2, 7)
   * f(x) = -3x² + 12x - 5
   * x = -b/(2a) = -12/(-6) = 2
   * f(2) = -3(4) + 12(2) - 5 = -12 + 24 - 5 = 7

10. Not a function because the input value 3 is paired with two different output values (3 and 7).
    * For a relation to be a function, each input value must correspond to exactly one output value

### Extended Response
11. a) f(x) = 2x² - 8x + 7
       = 2(x² - 4x) + 7
       = 2(x² - 4x + 4 - 4) + 7
       = 2(x - 2)² - 8 + 7
       = 2(x - 2)² - 1
    
    b) Vertex: (2, -1)
    
    c) The function has a minimum value of -1 (since a = 2 > 0, the parabola opens upward)
    
    d) [Graph should show a parabola opening upward with vertex at (2, -1) and y-intercept at (0, 7)]

12. a) Maximum height: 22 feet
       * h(t) = -16t² + 32t + 6
       * t = -b/(2a) = -32/(-32) = 1 second
       * h(1) = -16(1)² + 32(1) + 6 = -16 + 32 + 6 = 22 feet
    
    b) The ball reaches maximum height at t = 1 second
    
    c) The ball hits the ground when h(t) = 0:
       * -16t² + 32t + 6 = 0
       * Using the quadratic formula: t = (-32 ± √(32² - 4(-16)(6)))/(2(-16)) = (-32 ± √(1024 + 384))/(-32) = (-32 ± √1408)/(-32)
       * t ≈ -0.18 or t ≈ 2.18
       * Since negative time doesn't make sense in this context, the ball hits the ground at approximately 2.18 seconds
    
    d) Domain: 0 ≤ t ≤ 2.18 (time from when the ball is thrown until it hits the ground)
       Range: 0 ≤ h ≤ 22 (heights from ground level to maximum height)
