## Unit Objectives

By the end of this unit, students will be able to:
1. Identify and represent functions using multiple representations
2. Determine and interpret domain and range
3. Use function notation correctly and fluently
4. Find maximum and minimum values of quadratic functions
5. Simplify and operate with radical expressions
6. Solve quadratic equations using various methods
7. Create quadratic equations from given roots
8. Solve systems involving linear and quadratic equations

## Unit Flow & Progression

This unit follows a carefully sequenced progression from basic function concepts to more complex applications:

1. **Foundation Building** (Week 1)
   - Prerequisite skills review: Factoring
   - Introduction to functions, domain, and range
   - Function notation and applications

2. **Quadratic Functions Focus** (Week 2)
   - Properties of quadratics
   - Finding and interpreting maximum/minimum values
   - Vertex form and completing the square

3. **Problem Solving Tools** (Week 3)
   - Working with radicals
   - Solving quadratic equations
   - The discriminant and nature of roots

4. **Advanced Applications** (Week 4)
   - Creating quadratic equations from roots
   - Solving linear-quadratic systems
   - Real-world applications and modeling

## Key Teaching Strategies Implemented

This unit plan intentionally incorporates strategies from our teaching approach:

1. **Building Confidence**: Each topic begins with accessible entry points and gradually increases in complexity
2. **Real-World Connections**: Every concept is tied to relevant applications in gaming, sports, or technology
3. **Diverse Learning Methods**: Visual, kinesthetic, and interactive approaches are built into each lesson
4. **Technology Integration**: Strategic use of simulations, visualizations, and digital tools
5. **Scaffolded Learning**: Complex topics are broken down into manageable chunks
6. **Supportive Assessment**: Multiple opportunities for low-stakes practice and demonstration of learning
7. **Safe Learning Environment**: Emphasis on participation and process over perfect answers

## Implementation Notes

- This plan assumes 75-minute class periods meeting daily
- The pace can be adjusted based on student progress and needs
- Additional support resources are provided for differentiation
- Each lesson includes "quick wins" to build student confidence
