# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Functions

## Overview
This lesson introduces students to the concept of functions, domain, and range using real-world connections and interactive elements to engage students who struggle with abstract mathematical concepts.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Distinguish between relations and functions
2. Determine if a relation is a function using the vertical line test
3. Identify domain and range from multiple representations
4. Connect function concepts to real-world applications

## Materials & Technology
- Interactive digital dashboard (Desmos or GeoGebra)
- Sports statistics database access
- Function matching cards (physical or digital)
- Whiteboards and markers for each student
- Student devices with internet access

## Warm-Up Activity (10 minutes)
**"Real Life Connections"**
- Present students with several real-world scenarios on the board:
  * Heart rate over time while gaming
  * Points scored by player over games played
  * Speed of a car over distance traveled
  * YouTube views over days since posting
- Have students discuss in pairs: "Which inputs give you exactly one output? Which might give multiple outputs?"

## Direct Instruction (15 minutes)
**Key Concepts Introduction**
1. Define relation vs. function using examples from warm-up
2. Introduce the "vertical line test" with visual models
3. Define domain (input values) and range (output values)
4. Demonstrate multiple representations of functions:
   * Tables
   * Graphs
   * Equations
   * Verbal descriptions

## Guided Practice: "Function Detective" (20 minutes)
Students work in pairs with one computer:
1. Present a series of interactive graphs in Desmos representing real data (sports statistics, gaming scores, etc.)
2. For each graph, students must:
   * Determine if it's a function
   * Identify the domain and range
   * Explain what the relationship represents in real-world terms
   * Predict what happens outside the shown domain
3. Immediate feedback is provided through the interactive platform

## Independent Practice: "Function Sorting Challenge" (15 minutes)
Students individually:
1. Receive a set of 10 different relations in various formats (graphs, tables, equations)
2. Sort them into "functions" and "non-functions"
3. For each function, identify domain and range
4. Record their reasoning on individual whiteboards
5. Check answers with a partner before submitting

## Real-World Application Activity: "Gaming Stats Analyzer" (10 minutes)
1. Present students with actual gaming statistics (e.g., player performance data from popular games)
2. Have them identify which statistics represent functions
3. Discuss why certain game metrics are functions while others aren't
4. Connect to how game developers use functions to balance gameplay

## Closure: "3-2-1 Reflection" (5 minutes)
Students write down:
- 3 examples of functions they encounter in daily life
- 2 ways to determine if a relation is a function
- 1 question they still have about functions

## Extension Activities
- **For visual learners**: Create a visual representation of a function from their favorite game or sport
- **For tech-oriented students**: Program a simple function calculator that validates inputs/outputs
- **For hands-on learners**: Create a physical model demonstrating a function machine

## Assessment
- Formative: Observations during guided practice, whiteboard responses
- Exit ticket: Students classify 3 new relations and identify domain/range of 1 function
- Digital homework: Interactive Desmos assignment with personalized feedback

## Differentiation
- Struggling students: Focus on graphical representations and vertical line test
- Advanced students: Explore piecewise functions and their applications in game design
- Support: Provide function/non-function reference sheet with visual cues

## Homework
- Complete the interactive Desmos assignment "Function Detective: Level 2"
- Textbook practice: Page 12 #1-2, 3ace, 5
- Extension (optional): Find and document 3 examples of functions in a game or sport of choice
