# Quadratic Function Game Station

## Overview
This hands-on activity transforms learning about quadratic functions into an interactive, multi-station experience. Students rotate through stations that reinforce different aspects of quadratic functions using gaming elements, competition, and real-world applications. The stations are specifically designed to appeal to teenage students who might otherwise struggle to engage with abstract mathematical concepts.

## Learning Objectives
- Find vertex and maximum/minimum values of quadratic functions
- Convert between different forms of quadratic expressions
- Apply completing the square technique
- Solve quadratic equations using multiple methods
- Interpret real-world applications of quadratic functions

## Materials Needed
- Student tablets/laptops with Desmos access
- Printed game cards and station instructions
- Small whiteboards and markers
- Sports equipment (basketball, soccer ball)
- Digital timer/scoreboard
- QR codes linking to video tutorials
- Colored sticky notes

## Station Setup (75-minute class period)
Each station takes approximately 15 minutes. Students rotate through 4-5 stations during the class period.

### Station 1: "Vertex Sniper"
**Concept**: Completing the square and finding the vertex
**Activity**: 
1. Students access the custom-built "Vertex Sniper" Desmos activity
2. They are presented with quadratic functions in standard form
3. Using completing the square, they must find the vertex coordinates
4. Their answer "fires" at the target; closer answers score higher points
5. Difficulty increases with each level

**Materials**: 
- Tablets with Desmos activity (URL: provided separately)
- Vertex Sniper score cards
- Reference sheet with completing the square steps

**Real-World Connection**:
Short video intro connects vertex finding to optimal launch angles in popular video games

### Station 2: "Maximum Impact"
**Concept**: Maximum/minimum values of quadratic functions
**Activity**:
1. Basketball/soccer ball provided with measuring tape
2. Students throw/kick the ball while another records trajectory points
3. Using the Desmos app, they plot points and fit a quadratic function
4. They must find the maximum height using algebraic methods
5. Compare their calculated maximum to their observed maximum
6. Bonus challenge: Predict distance needed to reach a certain height

**Materials**:
- Basketball or soccer ball
- Measuring tape
- Tablets with Desmos
- Recording sheet for trajectory data

**Safety Note**: Ensure adequate space for this activity and establish clear boundaries

### Station 3: "Quadratic Code-Breaker"
**Concept**: Solving quadratic equations
**Activity**:
1. Students are presented with a "locked" digital treasure chest
2. To unlock it, they must solve a series of quadratic equations
3. Each solution reveals part of the combination
4. Equations progressively require different solving methods:
   - Factoring
   - Square root method
   - Completing the square
   - Quadratic formula
5. Final unlock reveals a reward (digital badge or bonus points)

**Materials**:
- Digital code-breaker app or printed cards with QR code verification
- Whiteboard for working solutions
- Reference guide for solution methods

**Differentiation**:
Different difficulty paths are available, with optional hints that can be "purchased" with previously earned points

### Station 4: "Discriminant Detectives"
**Concept**: Using the discriminant to predict roots
**Activity**:
1. Students are given "mystery functions" in sealed envelopes
2. Without graphing, they calculate the discriminant
3. Based on the discriminant, they predict:
   - Number of x-intercepts (0, 1, or 2)
   - Whether roots are rational or irrational
   - If irrational, whether they're conjugate pairs
4. After making predictions, they use graphing technology to verify
5. Points awarded for correct predictions

**Materials**:
- Mystery function cards in sealed envelopes
- Detective worksheets for recording predictions
- Calculators
- Verification tablets with graphing software

### Station 5: "Quadratic Application Arena"
**Concept**: Real-world applications of quadratic functions
**Activity**:
1. Students choose from 3-4 real-world scenarios:
   - Sports trajectory (e.g., basketball shot)
   - Revenue optimization (e.g., ticket pricing)
   - Structural design (e.g., bridge arch)
   - Game physics (e.g., angry birds style projectile)
2. For their chosen scenario, they solve a multi-step problem
3. Create visual representation of their solution
4. Record a 30-second video explanation on tablet

**Materials**:
- Scenario cards with real-world problems
- Modeling materials (graph paper, 3D manipulatives)
- Tablets for recording explanations

## Assessment Strategy
- Each station includes a quick self-check component
- Students collect "achievement badges" for completed stations
- Digital leaderboard (optional) shows station completion across class
- Exit ticket synthesizes learning from multiple stations

## Differentiation Options
- **Support level**: Each station has QR codes linking to hint videos
- **Challenge level**: "Boss challenges" available for students who complete stations quickly
- **Alternative paths**: Multiple ways to demonstrate understanding at each station
- **Collaboration option**: Students can choose to work individually or in pairs

## Implementation Notes
1. Introduce station format and expectations before beginning
2. Provide a station tracker sheet for students to manage rotation
3. Each station should have clearly posted instructions and time limit
4. Teacher circulates to provide support and ensure engagement
5. Consider having a "home base" where students can take a brief break if feeling overwhelmed

## Digital Component Requirements
If pursuing full digital implementation, the following would need development:
- Desmos "Vertex Sniper" interactive activity
- Digital "Code-Breaker" application
- Electronic station tracker and badge system
- Video tutorial repository for station supports

## Optional Extension: "Boss Level Challenge"
For students who complete all stations or need additional challenge:

A comprehensive problem combining elements from all stations where students must:
1. Identify a quadratic model from a complex scenario
2. Find key features (vertex, intercepts, etc.)
3. Make predictions and optimize outcomes
4. Create a visual representation of their solution
5. Present their solution in a creative format

This activity takes the gaming concept to the next level while integrating all the key learning objectives from the unit.
