## Answer Key

### Part A: Identifying Functions

1. a) Yes, this is a function. Each input (first coordinate) corresponds to exactly one output (second coordinate).
   
   b) Yes, this is a function. Although multiple inputs map to the same output (5), each input still has exactly one output.
   
   c) No, this is not a function. The input 1 corresponds to two different outputs (2 and 3), which violates the definition of a function.
   
   d) Yes, this is a function. Each input has exactly one output.

2. a) No, x² + y² = 25 is not a function of x. For most values of x, there are two possible values of y. For example, when x = 3, y could be 4 or -4.
   
   b) Yes, y = |x - 3| is a function. For any value of x, there is exactly one value of y.
   
   c) No, x = y² is not a function of x. When written as y = ±√(x), we see that for positive values of x, there are two possible values of y.
   
   d) No, xy = 12 is not a function of x. When written as y = 12/x, we see that for any non-zero value of x, there is exactly one value of y, but the relation is not defined when x = 0.

3. [Answers would depend on the specific graphs provided]
   - A parabola passes the vertical line test, so it represents a function.
   - A circle fails the vertical line test, so it does not represent a function.
   - A straight line passes the vertical line test, so it represents a function.
   - A cubic function passes the vertical line test, so it represents a function.

### Part B: Finding Domain and Range

4. a) f(x) = 2x - 5
      Domain: All real numbers
      Range: All real numbers
   
   b) f(x) = x² + 3
      Domain: All real numbers
      Range: y ≥ 3
   
   c) f(x) = 1/(x - 2)
      Domain: All real numbers except x = 2
      Range: All real numbers except y = 0
   
   d) f(x) = √(x + 4)
      Domain: x ≥ -4
      Range: y ≥ 0

5. [Answers would depend on the specific graphs provided]

6. For the piecewise function:
   f(x) = x² if x < 0
   f(x) = 2x + 1 if x ≥ 0
   
   Domain: All real numbers
   
   Range: y ≥ 0 for the first piece (x < 0) and y ≥ 1 for the second piece (x ≥ 0)
   Therefore, the range is y ≥ 0

### Part C: Function Notation and Evaluation

7. If f(x) = 3x² - 4x + 2:
   a) f(0) = 3(0)² - 4(0) + 2 = 0 - 0 + 2 = 2
   
   b) f(-1) = 3(-1)² - 4(-1) + 2 = 3(1) + 4 + 2 = 3 + 4 + 2 = 9
   
   c) f(2) = 3(2)² - 4(2) + 2 = 3(4) - 8 + 2 = 12 - 8 + 2 = 6
   
   d) f(a) = 3a² - 4a + 2
   
   e) f(a+h) = 3(a+h)² - 4(a+h) + 2 = 3(a² + 2ah + h²) - 4a - 4h + 2 = 3a² + 6ah + 3h² - 4a - 4h + 2

8. If g(x) = (x+1)/(x-3):
   a) g(0) = (0+1)/(0-3) = 1/(-3) = -1/3
   
   b) g(4) = (4+1)/(4-3) = 5/1 = 5
   
   c) g(-1) = (-1+1)/(-1-3) = 0/(-4) = 0
   
   d) g(x) is undefined when x = 3 (denominator equals zero)

9. For the function h(x) = |x - 2| + 3:
   a) h(0) = |0 - 2| + 3 = |-2| + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5
   
   b) h(2) = |2 - 2| + 3 = |0| + 3 = 0 + 3 = 3
   
   c) h(5) = |5 - 2| + 3 = |3| + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6
   
   d) h(x) = 3 when |x - 2| = 0, which occurs when x = 2

### Part D: Applications

10. a) If the perimeter is 100 meters, and w is the width, then the length l = 50 - w
       Area function: A(w) = w · l = w(50 - w) = 50w - w²
    
    b) Domain: 0 < w < 50 (width must be positive and less than half the perimeter)
    
    c) To find the maximum:
       A'(w) = 50 - 2w = 0
       w = 25 meters
       The length is also l = 50 - 25 = 25 meters
       The dimensions that maximize the area are 25 m × 25 m (a square)

11. For the cost function C(x) = 500 + 25x:
    a) Fixed cost = $500
    
    b) Cost per item = $25
    
    c) C(100) = 500 + 25(100) = 500 + 2500 = $3000
    
    d) To find how many items can be produced for $2000:
       2000 = 500 + 25x
       1500 = 25x
       x = 60 items

12. For the height function h(t) = -4.9t² + 20t + 1.5:
    a) Initial height: h(0) = -4.9(0)² + 20(0) + 1.5 = 0 + 0 + 1.5 = 1.5 meters
    
    b) To find when the ball reaches maximum height:
       h'(t) = -9.8t + 20 = 0
       t = 20/9.8 ≈ 2.04 seconds
    
    c) Maximum height:
       h(2.04) = -4.9(2.04)² + 20(2.04) + 1.5
       = -4.9(4.16) + 40.8 + 1.5
       = -20.38 + 40.8 + 1.5
       = 21.92 meters
    
    d) The ball hits the ground when h(t) = 0:
       -4.9t² + 20t + 1.5 = 0
       
       Using the quadratic formula:
       t = (-20 ± √(400 + 29.4))/(-9.8) = (-20 ± √429.4)/(-9.8) = (-20 ± 20.72)/(-9.8)
       
       t = (-20 + 20.72)/(-9.8) ≈ -0.07 (negative time, discard)
       
       t = (-20 - 20.72)/(-9.8) ≈ 4.16 seconds
