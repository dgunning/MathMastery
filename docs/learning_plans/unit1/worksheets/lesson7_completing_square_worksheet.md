      * Half of -8 is -4, and (-4)² = 16
   
   c) x² + 5x = (x + 2.5)² - 6.25
      * Half of 5 is 2.5, and (2.5)² = 6.25

      * Half of 10 is 5, and 5² = 25
   
   b) x² - 12x + 20 = (x - 6)² - 36 + 20 = (x - 6)² - 16
      * Half of -12 is -6, and (-6)² = 36
   
   c) x² + 7x - 15 = (x + 3.5)² - 12.25 - 15 = (x + 3.5)² - 27.25
      * Half of 7 is 3.5, and (3.5)² = 12.25
   
   d) x² - 5x - 24 = (x - 2.5)² - 6.25 - 24 = (x - 2.5)² - 30.25
      * Half of -5 is -2.5, and (-2.5)² = 6.25

3. a) 2x² + 12x + 10 = 2(x² + 6x) + 10 = 2(x² + 6x + 9 - 9) + 10 = 2(x + 3)² - 18 + 10 = 2(x + 3)² - 8

### Part D: Applications

10. Let w be the width of the garden and w + 3 be the length.
    Area = w(w + 3) = 70
    w² + 3w = 70
    w² + 3w - 70 = 0
    
    Complete the square:
    w² + 3w + 9/4 - 9/4 - 70 = 0
    (w + 3/2)² - 9/4 - 70 = 0
    (w + 3/2)² = 9/4 + 70 = 9/4 + 280/4 = 289/4
    w + 3/2 = ±17/2
    
    Since width must be positive, w = -3/2 + 17/2 = 7
    
    The dimensions of the garden are 7 meters by 10 meters.

11. a) h(t) = -4.9t² + 20t + 2
       = -4.9(t² - 20/-4.9t) + 2
       = -4.9(t² - 4.08t) + 2
       = -4.9(t² - 4.08t + 4.16 - 4.16) + 2
       = -4.9(t - 2.04)² + 20.38 + 2
       = -4.9(t - 2.04)² + 22.38
       Vertex form: h(t) = -4.9(t - 2.04)² + 22.38
    
    b) The maximum height is 22.38 meters.
    
    c) The ball reaches its maximum height at t = 2.04 seconds.
    
    d) The ball hits the ground when h(t) = 0:
       -4.9(t - 2.04)² + 22.38 = 0
       -4.9(t - 2.04)² = -22.38
       (t - 2.04)² = 22.38/4.9 ≈ 4.57
       t - 2.04 = ±√4.57 ≈ ±2.14
       t = 2.04 ± 2.14
       t = 4.18 or t = -0.1
       
       Since negative time doesn't make sense in this context, the ball hits the ground at approximately 4.18 seconds.

12. a) P(x) = -0.5x² + 100x - 1000
       = -0.5(x² - 200x) - 1000

       = -0.5(x - 100)² + 5000 - 1000
       = -0.5(x - 100)² + 4000
       Vertex form: P(x) = -0.5(x - 100)² + 4000
    
    b) The profit is maximized when x = 100 items.
    
    c) The maximum profit is P(100) = 4000 dollars.
    
    d) To find the break-even points, set P(x) = 0:
       -0.5(x - 100)² + 4000 = 0
       -0.5(x - 100)² = -4000
       (x - 100)² = 8000
       x - 100 = ±√8000 ≈ ±89.44
       x = 100 ± 89.44
       x ≈ 189.44 or x ≈ 10.56
       
       The break-even points are approximately 11 items and 189 items.

### Part E: Challenge Problems

13. f(x) = 2x² - 8x + 13
    = 2(x² - 4x) + 13
    = 2(x² - 4x + 4 - 4) + 13
    = 2(x - 2)² - 8 + 13
    = 2(x - 2)² + 5
    
    The minimum value of f(x) is 5, which occurs at x = 2.

14. f(x) = ax² + bx + c (where a ≠ 0)
    = a(x² + b/a·x) + c
    = a(x² + b/a·x + b²/4a² - b²/4a²) + c
    = a(x + b/2a)² - b²/4a + c
    
    The vertex form is f(x) = a(x + b/2a)² + (c - b²/4a)
    
    The x-coordinate of the vertex is -b/2a.

15. For a quadratic function with vertex at (3, -4) and passing through (5, 0):
    f(x) = a(x - 3)² - 4
    
    Since the function passes through (5, 0):
    0 = a(5 - 3)² - 4
    0 = 4a - 4
    4a = 4
    a = 1
    
    Therefore, f(x) = (x - 3)² - 4
