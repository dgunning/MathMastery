    b) For what value(s) of v will the projectile reach a height of 30 meters?
    c) For what value(s) of v will the projectile never reach a height of 50 meters?

13. The profit P(x) (in dollars) for producing and selling x items is given by P(x) = -2x² + 100x - k, where k is the fixed cost.
    a) If k = 1000, find the values of x for which the company makes a profit (i.e., P(x) > 0).
    b) For what value(s) of k will the company make a profit for exactly one value of x?
    c) For what value(s) of k will the company never make a profit?
