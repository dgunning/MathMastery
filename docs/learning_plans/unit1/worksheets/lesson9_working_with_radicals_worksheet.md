13. The period T (in seconds) of a simple pendulum is given by T = 2π√(L/g), where L is the length of the pendulum (in meters) and g = 9.8 m/s² is the acceleration due to gravity.
    a) Find the period of a pendulum with length 2 meters.
    b) If the period of a pendulum is 3 seconds, what is its length?
    c) If the length of a pendulum is quadrupled, how does the period change?
    d) A pendulum on the moon has the same length as a pendulum on Earth, but the acceleration due to gravity on the moon is 1.6 m/s². How does the period of the pendulum on the moon compare to its period on Earth?

14. The distance d (in miles) that you can see to the horizon from a height h (in feet) is approximately d = √(1.5h).

    c) If you double your height, by what factor does your viewing distance increase?
    d) You are in a hot air balloon. When you are at a height of 400 feet, you can see a ship on the horizon. If you rise to a height of 900 feet, how much farther can you see?

15. The time t (in seconds) it takes an object to fall from a height h (in meters) is given by t = √(2h/g), where g = 9.8 m/s² is the acceleration due to gravity.
