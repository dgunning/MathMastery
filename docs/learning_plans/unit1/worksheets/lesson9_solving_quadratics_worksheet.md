### Part D: Applications

10. Let x and y be the length and width of the garden.
    From the perimeter: 2x + 2y = 26, so x + y = 13
    From the area: xy = 40
    
    Substituting y = 13 - x into the area equation:
    x(13 - x) = 40
    13x - x² = 40
    x² - 13x + 40 = 0
    
    Using the quadratic formula:
    x = (13 ± √(169 - 160))/2 = (13 ± √9)/2 = (13 ± 3)/2
    x = 8 or x = 5
    
    If x = 8, then y = 13 - 8 = 5
    If x = 5, then y = 13 - 5 = 8
    
    The dimensions of the garden are 8 meters by 5 meters.

11. The ball hits the ground when h(t) = 0:
    -4.9t² + 24t = 0
    t(-4.9t + 24) = 0
    t = 0 or t = 24/4.9 ≈ 4.9
    
    Since t = 0 represents the initial time, the ball hits the ground again after approximately 4.9 seconds.

12. Let x be the first integer and x + 1 be the next consecutive integer.
    x(x + 1) = 72
    x² + x = 72
    x² + x - 72 = 0
    
    Using the quadratic formula:
    x = (-1 ± √(1 + 288))/2 = (-1 ± √289)/2 = (-1 ± 17)/2
    x = 8 or x = -9
    
    If x = 8, then x + 1 = 9
    If x = -9, then x + 1 = -8
    
    The pairs of consecutive integers are 8 and 9, or -9 and -8.

13. Revenue = Price × Quantity = $p \times x = (50 - 0.5x) \times x = 50x - 0.5x^2$
    Cost = $C(x) = 10x + 200$
    Profit = Revenue - Cost = $50x - 0.5x^2 - 10x - 200 = -0.5x^2 + 40x - 200$
    
    To maximize profit, find the vertex of the quadratic function:
    $x = \frac{-40}{2(-0.5)} = \frac{40}{1} = 40$
    
    The company should produce 40 units to maximize profit.

### Part E: Word Problems

14. Let x be the number.
    x + 1/x = 5/2
    (x² + 1)/x = 5/2
    2(x² + 1) = 5x
    2x² - 5x + 2 = 0
    
    Using the quadratic formula:
    x = (5 ± √(25 - 16))/4 = (5 ± √9)/4 = (5 ± 3)/4
    x = 2 or x = 1/2
    
    The numbers are 2 and 1/2.

15. Let v be the speed of the boat in still water.
    Speed upstream = v - 3
    Speed downstream = v + 3
    
    Time upstream = 24/(v - 3)
    Time downstream = 24/(v + 3)
    
    Total time = 5 hours:
    24/(v - 3) + 24/(v + 3) = 5
    
    Multiply all terms by (v - 3)(v + 3):
    24(v + 3) + 24(v - 3) = 5(v - 3)(v + 3)
    24v + 72 + 24v - 72 = 5(v² - 9)
    48v = 5v² - 45
    5v² - 48v - 45 = 0
    
    Using the quadratic formula:
    v = (48 ± √(2304 + 900))/10 = (48 ± √3204)/10 = (48 ± 56.6)/10
    v ≈ 10.5 or v ≈ -0.9
    
    Since speed must be positive, the speed of the boat in still water is approximately 10.5 km/h.

16. Let v be the speed of the slower car and v + 15 be the speed of the faster car.
    In 2 hours, the slower car travels 2v km and the faster car travels 2(v + 15) = 2v + 30 km.
    
    Total distance between them = 170 km:
    2v + 2v + 30 = 170
    4v + 30 = 170
    4v = 140
    v = 35
    
    The speeds of the cars are 35 km/h and 50 km/h.
