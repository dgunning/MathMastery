# MCR3U: Functions, Grade 11, University Preparation

## Course Description

This course introduces the mathematical concept of the function by extending students’ experiences with linear and quadratic relations. Students will investigate properties of discrete and continuous functions, including trigonometric and exponential functions; represent functions numerically, algebraically, and graphically; solve problems involving applications of functions; investigate inverse functions; and develop facility in determining equivalent algebraic expressions. Students will reason mathematically and communicate their thinking as they solve multi-step problems.

## Assessment and Evaluation

Assessment and evaluation are based on the principles outlined in the *Growing Success: Assessment, Evaluation, and Reporting in Ontario Schools* document. A variety of assessment methods will be used, including:

*   Fair, transparent, and equitable practices.
*   Support for all students, including those with special needs.
*   Ongoing, varied, and multiple opportunities to demonstrate learning.
*   Descriptive feedback to support improvement.
*   Development of self-assessment skills.
